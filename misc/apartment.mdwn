Here are some assorted notes about the apartment at 41st and Chestnut.

## Utilities
The heat is controlled centrally. Chris Nares (landlord) gave me a space heater.

You can use the internet access from the pizza restaurant. The ESSID is
something like "NS Pizza", and the password is Chris Nares's phone number.

Only USPS can deliver to the apartment. You can talk to Chris Nares about
having him receive deliveries at the pizza restaurant. The apartment number
is "PH 1".

Garbage is collected from the street on Tuesday mornings. You can drop things
there or drop things any time in the dumpster. To get to the dumpster, turn
left after you exit the main door to the building.

## Furnishings
Chris Montepara left the tables and wardrobe, clothes rack, refrigerator,
and some assorted supplies. I'm going to leave them too.

The bed belongs to Nares.

I'm plan on taking everything else with me (mostly bedding and clothes).
I'm happy to leave the electric steamer and some blankets if they'll get used.
