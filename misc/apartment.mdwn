Here are some assorted notes about the apartment at 41st and Chestnut.

## Utilities
The heat is controlled centrally. Chris Nares (landlord) gave me a space heater.

## Furnishings
Chris Montepara left the tables and wardrobe, clothes rack, refrigerator,
and some assorted supplies. I'm going to leave them too.

The bed belongs to Nares.

I'm plan on taking everything else with me (mostly bedding and clothes).
I'm happy to leave the electric steamer and some blankets if they'll get used.
