People use lots of rags when cleaning printing presses.

As of April 2014, Risley's letterpress shop is running
low on rags.

## 2010 Rag purchase
Risley purchased 30 pounds of rags in May 2010, and they
seem to have worked out well. Here's some more information
about that purchase.

In case someone reading this doesn't know me and is thus
wondering why Risley letterpress information is on
Thomas Levine's website, it's because I was the shop manager
from 2008 to 2011.
