People use lots of rags when cleaning printing presses.

As of April 2014, Risley's letterpress shop is running
low on rags.

## 2010 Rag purchase
Risley purchased 30 pounds of rags in May 2010, and they
seem to have worked out well. Here's some more information
about that purchase.

I allocated some rags

The rags were allocated again on September 12, 2010,
and I guess we bought them shortly thereafter. Here is
the relevant section from the
*KOMMITTEE MINUTES FOR SEPTEMBER THE 12, 2010*
(FIRE MARSHALL LOVE/WOLVES ON A PLANE KOMMITTEE)

> Tom, $100, rags for the print shop.
> 
> Nolan: Are there specific rags or can we just find some old shirts?
> 
> Ben: He is going to buy them locally in bulk, they will last forever.
> 
> Jim: Are we still talking about this? Oh, I was recently in the print shop,
> and they really do use A LOT of rags, like really, and you need a special
> kind not to hurt your press or the print.
> 
> Sarah: Were these rags part of last weekâ€™s print shop allocation?
> 
> Ben: No.
> 
> Acclaimed.

Side note: Jim's comment about needing a special kind of rags is kind of wrong.
I guess you shouldn't use steel wool, but ordinary cheap cotton rags are fine.

## Tom
In case someone reading this doesn't know me and is thus
wondering why Risley letterpress information is on
Thomas Levine's website, it's because I was the shop manager
from 2008 to 2011.
