How to select your (Tom's) dwelling
==============

## Need
Here are some things that I care unusually much about.

* The place should be acoustically quiet. The building may be
    on a busy street, I shouldn't be able to hear that inside.
* The place should be heated well, or the place should be small
    so that a space heater can heat it.
* There should be room to use my projector.

## Laundry
I don't have very many clothes, and I do laundry often. As such,
I like to have either a washing machine or a tub/sink to soak laundry.

It's also helpful to have a place to dry clothes, but I can improvise there.

## Furnishings
It's better if the place is furnished. That said, I can do without the
typical furnishings if I'm renting a place long enough that it's worth
getting the portable furniture bag out of my storage unit.

* While a nice (firm) bed is quite welcome, I can do without a bed.
    (I have a camping pad.)
* A kitchen is welcome as well, but I can do without it.
    (I have an electric steamer.)

I find kitchens to be wastefully large, so I would much prefer not to have one.
Unfortunately, it's quite hard to find nice places without kitchens.
