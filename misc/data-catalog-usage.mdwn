Broadly, I want to measure the effect of the sharing of data ("open data")
on outcomes that people care about. That's a pretty grand goal, but as a start,
we can look for aspects of the software that affect how people publish data.

I thus want anything I can get that will tell me about how people are using
data catalogs. This includes

* Logs from pretty much anywhere within the application
* Information about the particular software that is being used
  * Version numbers
  * Product purchases
  * Support services
  * Contracts
* Information about other software that an organization considered
* Data from data catalog sales processes
  * Leads, prospects, &c.
  * Why people did or didn't seem interested in the software
