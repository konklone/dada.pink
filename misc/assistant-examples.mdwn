Forms and emails
===== 
A bunch of things keep coming up that involve reading a few websites,
filling out some clumsy forms, and sending some emails. I think
someone could be helpful on things like this. Here are some examples.

* Apply for me to speak at a conference that I tell you about;
    copy something that I've written (http://thomaslevine.com/!/)
    and fill out the rest of the application.
* Order a birth certificate, and fill out the forms for a passport
    application.
* Go to the weird site that houses my friend's dissertation, click
    through all the links to find the dissertation, download it,
    and email it to me.
* Submit freedom of information requests.

I think this is my issue with forms and emails: I don't really
like using computers, but I'm so fast at them that it make sense
for me to use computers for lots of things.

I'd like my to-be-assistant to do the following

## Conference applications
For each of these conferences, go to <http://thomaslevine.com/open-data>,
copy or summarize an appropriate article and submit it under my name.
