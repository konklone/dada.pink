ELAINE REPORT
-I sent out an email.  I’m leaving, and I’m weirded out by that.  Will be
starting an RHD search for Risley.  I’m phone interviewing this week.  I’m
not sure what will happen yet.  Look for emails about meeting candidates.

-Have 9 AIRs that we will be interviewing this week: 2 tech theatre, some
musicians, bunch of visual artists and writers.  Really good spread.
Initiatlly
had 10 but 1 withdrew.  Looking for someone with a theatre background just
in case the new RHD doesn’t have a theatre background.

-Anticipating lots of crying between now and leaving.  I was on the fence
all week.  I will come back and visit some time, and we will have an epic
BBBBQ.

here, I have never eaten there.

-Very interesting year.  I have a lot of respect for your discussions and
decisions.  This is where you form a lot of your decision-making skills that
are useful for life.  I’ve been very productive artwork-wise and in the
connections I’ve made during my time here.  Title of being AIR is a
significant honor and means a lot to me and the people I meet.  Thank you
for letting me occupy that position.  I really appreciate it.


WILL:
-not present

-Isaac on his behalf: Was a judge at Shakespeare competition.  Cabaret
happened.

 ANNOUNCEMENTS.
-Ben: Theatre Subkommittee selected plays and positions for next fall.  Will
send out email and update website.



-John: Last Kommittee for class of 2010.  Round of applause to fellow
seniors.

-Elaine: Largest class graduating in about 5 years.  You guys have rocked it
and survived some crazy stuff.



-Kim: We have an awesome volleyball set.  Watch out for emails and join us!


 OTHER BUSINESS.
-Approval of Minutes.

-Acclaimed.



-Sara: Interim replacements-people not coming back need to be replaced.  Molly
Edwards and Kate Orlofsky as a two-headed monster for chair.  Members at
large: Doug isn’t going to be here.  Would like to nominate Jen
Pierre.  Nomination
for Pat is Audrey Sutton.

-Kerry: How will the two headed monster of chairness work with the
secretariness?

-Sara: Kerry will take over responsbility of minutes.  Nolan will take over
for Molly.

-Jess: I think it should be Nolan for interim.  This whole chair thing makes
me not very happy.

-Jeff: Can we discuss voting?

-Nolan: Thanks for the nomination but I think Molly has a better handle on
the rules of charter.  Definitely more experience too.

-Acclaimed.



-Jess: Needed new RisLibrarian.  Recommending Alyssa Henning.  She’s very
responsible and would do a very good job keeping the place clean.

-Kim: Deos she have the time to maintain it?

-Jess: You work when you have free time. I’ve gone a month without cleaning.


-Sally:  Should we hear all the names of these nominees?

-Jess: Four responses to my email inquiry were Jen, Clover, Nate, and
Alyssa.

-Clover: Are multiple Rislibrarians possible?

-Hat Ben: If other candidates are wiling to be librarian.  I’ve never seen
Alyssa in the library and I know she’s very busy.

-Audrey: Isn’t the recommendation supposed to be a recommendation and not an
absolute?

-Sally: If busyness is an issue and presence is an issue, could we do
two-headed monster?

-Jess: It’s been my experience that the best librarians are good librarians
in short bursts.  I had Clover in mind for future, but no objection to
two-headed monster.

-Kerry: Is it possible to have a 3- or 4- headed monster?

-Elaine: Let’s just everyone be responsible for cleaning!

-Jen: I’d be up for being a three-headed monster.  I’ll be busy too but I’d
be up for being one of three heads.

-Jess: If something happens and papers explode everywhere, who would be held
accountable?

-Elaine: I’d hold all 3 accountable and the library accountable as well.  It’s
not unknown for me to lock the library.

-Jess: Just want accountability and organization.  Don’t want there to be
too many cooks in the kitchen…

-Sara: Ultimately up to you as it is your nomination Jess.

-Jeff: More than 2 people is getting iffy.  3 heads isn’t in charter.  I
have no idea which 2 of 3 would be best.

-Jess: My recommendation is Alyssa but if someone wants to help out if she’s
struggling, I’d support that.  I’d like to nominate Clover and Alyssa.

-Acclaimed.



-Jess: This will be unpleasant, but hopefully short and simple.  I’m coming
as a concerned member of the community and I have nothing against Sara as a
person.  List of formal grievances and have printed out copies for people to
read. Charter states chair should run and facilitate smooth running
meetings.  I don’t think this was carried out. There were long kommittees
that were kind of dull, which is subjective.  Some disregard of
charter.  Changed
charter to suit own agenda. Felt weren’t enough opinions at charter review.
Appointment of interim chair was kind of shady.  Supported by just the
general overrule of appointments.  I can’t make a motion for anything.

-Rocky: Motion to move on to next topic.



-Doug: I was talking with Bennett, Sally, and Kim and there’s currently an
issue with Nike and Cornell.  Cornell uses Nike for sporting clothing stuff
and there’s currently a problem in that Nike owes $2.6 million in severance
pay to workers in Haiti.  Something in Cornell’s Code of Conduct against
this saying company must be held responsible for subcontractors.  COLA is
sponsoring a motion to protest this and trying to get Cornell to sever
relationship with Nike and replace with a different company.  Motion to
endorse the protests because clear violation of Cornell’s Code of conduct.

-Audrey: How exactly does endorsing work?

-Doug: List of groups opposed to Nike’s presence.

-Nolan: What’s COLA?

-Doug: Cornell group.

-Miles: How would we be listed?

-Risley Residential College.

-Acclaimed.



ALLOCATIONS:
-Dasha:  Risley has been enjoying playing Bananagrams.  $15 at mall.

-Elaine: It’s like scrabble without the board.

-Bennett: Let’s get 2!

-Dasha: I think one is enough, but whatever you want.  Why would we need
two?

-Miles: Could have one larger game.

-Bennett: This could generate sufficient interest and it’s $30.

-Clover: Also, really only works for up to 4 people.

-Elaine: If it’s outside of 6, it’s exclusionary.

-Dasha: Ammended motion for 2.

-Acclaimed.



-Dasha: Mentioned hidden pictures mural a few weeks ago.  Want to work on
with Aiden. Have narrowed down to two choices.

-Isaac: Would like to be able to stare at this mural and find fun things.

-Jeff: Should approve and trust mural artists with whichever one they
decide.

-Rocky: They’re not that much different in style.

-Dasha: Thinking of doing in the dance studio hallway near the vending
machines.

-Miles: Time table behind this?

-Dasha: Probably study week or week after. Is there paint?

-Elaine: I will just buy it.

-Acclaimed.



-Sara: RisOC money for awesome RisOC programs.  $500.

-Acclaimed.



-Nate: TVR on Saturday from noon-3 for RisBrunch.

-Elaine: Making our own Saturday cartoons!

-Nate: Looney Tunes.

-Elaine: TV will be fixed by then.  How many more things will break before I
leave?

-Miles: Is this a RisBrunch?

-Elaine: I’m making pancakes!  I will make facilities get us a new TV if it
is broken.

-Acclaimed.



-Kerry: $100 for getting Elaine a present.

-Elaine: How can I buy myself a present?  That’s embezzlement!

-Kerry: I got you a felony!

-Sara: Send out to listserve for donations…



-Rocky: As you guys know, RisPrinter experiment has been ongoing.  About
5,000 pages printed since beginning of the semester.  Quite a useful tool
for everyone.  Instructions are online.  Costs between $200-$250 per
semester to print what you want in terms of toner and paper.  Community
needs to decide now about whether or not we want to keep this.  Keep with
thought in mind of what it costs.  Cost allows 12,000-15,000 pages/semester.

-Miles: Is this based on an ideal semester where we have a continual supply
of toner or on numbers from this semester?

-Rocky: This is for ideal semester.  Calculated number of pages based on if
had continual supply.

-Nolan: Have you found managers?

-Rocky: Gabriel Clandorf and Dan Levine.

-Isaac: Can we put your face on the printer?  I would paint a mural of you.

-Audrey: Did we ever buy paper for printer using Risley money?

-Rocky: We did yes.  Went to Olin and charged to account.

-Acclaimed.



-Jim: A couple of weeks ago we had problems with rowdiness at kommittee and
I brought up the idea of RisSheriff for Kommittee.  Could allocate a
suitable weapon for this sheriff.  Went to mall and looked at nerf weapons.
$30 for Nerf N-strike Recon.  Formidable close range weapon with light beam
for pinpoint accuracy.  Multiple firing capacity.

-Julia: You’re my favorite.  We do have an influx of foam weapons.

-Elaine: Which will hopefully be here before BBBBQ.

-Julia: Some unhappy interactions in the past with campus life and nerf
guns.  I was under the impression they were banned.

-Elaine: 4 years ago there were problems in a campus wide game of Assassins.
Cornell police department made a ban on the weapons.  Taken to an intense
level.

-Nate: If it’s a matter of keeping order, can just use the hockey stick.

-Win: Might be a NY state law that you can’t have them on university campus.

-Jim: Risley needs protection.

-Isaac: These bullets will be lost.

-Jim: But can buy in packs for $2.

-Jeff: Foam weapons are exactly why we need a nerf weapons.  The sheriff
needs weapons superior to foam swords.  Air powered weapons are what are
banned, not nerf specifically.

-Nolan: I guess it’s air-powered that are bad.  If there is a weapon or
“toy” that is spring-powered, I’d say we could allocate money.

-Lauren: Need to figure out how to make this allowable.  Can keep rowdiness
down by reviewing rules because sometimes people forget.  Everyone likes
everyone so people get conversational.  Perhaps a combo of brute force and
education would do the trick.

-Audrey: Have to actually create position of RisSheriff.  Kind of two
separate things.  Can create position without having allocated money should
the nerf gun be illegal.

-Elaine: Then the position has no power behind it.  Water gun perhaps?
That’s how you keep cats under control.  I’d get you a slingshot complete
with a Dennis the Menace outfit.  I would pay to come back to see someone
looking like Dennis the Menace.

-Rocky: I love you Jim, but I also want to call the question.

-Jim: $30 for future toy for RisBailiff.

-Kerry: There is a RisPerlatives category for best komitee motion!  Just
saying…

-Acclaimed.



-Tom: Let’s ignore the fan and baby wipes for the print shop.  The rags
would be useful in the near future because need to clean in Print Shop.  Rags
over tee shirts because rags cheaper and cut in a better way so you get more
use out of them.  $100 for lots of rags.

-Jeff: Budget? I would kind of like the fan for getting strange things in
the air out.

-Tom: Fan and baby wipes could be for next year.  Rags would be useful soon.

-Jeff: We have $400.  If we want this fan, we may as well allocate now.

-Elaine: Working on getting exhaust system for shops, but not making any
promises.

-Bennett: Should we allocate for the eventuality in case ventilation system
doesn’t go through?

-Tom: Would facilities pay for a fan?

-Elaine: I have one I think.

-Molly: How long would supply last?

-Tom: They say you can wash them, but we don’t.  This is more than we had at
beginning of last year and those have lasted almost a year.

-Acclaimed.



-Tom: $20 for lots of baby wipes.

-Sally: Will they dry up over the summer?

-Tom: Could have for RisOrientation.

-Isaac: Welcome to Risley, here’s a baby wipe.

-Motion withdrawn.



-Rocky: I’d like to allocate a thank you for letting me live here all these
years.

            -Acclaimed.



OTHER OTHER BUSINESS.
-John: Tradition that chair be exectued by hemlock.

-Elaine: I need to make comments!

-John: I motion that we execute Elaine and Sara by hemlock.

-Sara: I guess Elaine is first.

-Elaine: I just wanted to say some stuff about Sara because I feel like you
got thrashed today.  You’re the first female chair we’ve had in a while and
the first non-2-headed monster we’ve had for a while too.  Easier to have 2
heads and you’ve done a superb job.  Thanks for being awesome and taking
this on by yourself.  I know you took some heat this year and it was not
deserved.

-Nate: Please don’t kill my boss.  If there’s going to be an execution, let
me take off my uniform so I am not violating state law.

-Jeff: Not tradition.  Have only exectued one of the kommittee chairs (and
in reality ½ because it was one head of a 2-headed monster).  While we have
a provision to exectue, no motion to be able to specify.

-John: I retract my motion because it’s ridiculous and I just wanted that to
be my last act in Risley.  Besides, I have no hemlock
