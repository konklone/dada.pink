This Sunday, March 30, is the anniversity of my birthday,
so something fun is going to happen.

Not Pizza
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If I thought it was going
to be warm out, I would go to Staten Island in the afternoon
to taste the two remaining pizza restaurants on my list.

Museum of Math
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
But I don't think it's going to be warm out, so let's go
somewhere more convenient; meet here at **1 pm**.

    | National Museum of Mathematics
    | 11 East 26th Street

We could do something after the Museum of Math; ideas follow.

Other things
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See a few things around 24th street? (I'm turning 24.)
This is in a rather central location for everyone.

  (Buy tickets `online <https://in.momath.org/civicrm/event/register?reset=1&id=71>`_ to save a dollar.)
* http://www.unixgallery.com/ (nothing to do with unix)

Go to Saint Thomas Church, Tom's Restaurant, and the 24th NYPD precinct?
This would be on the upper west side and thus inconvenient for most people.
