This Sunday, March 30, is the anniversity of my birthday,
so something fun is going to happen. If I thought it was going
to be warm out, I would go to Staten Island in the afternoon
to taste the two remaining pizza restaurants on my list.

But I don't think it's going to be warm out, so I'm going to
go somewhere more convenient. And I would love for you to join.

What to do
-------------

See a few things on 24th street? Probably museums or galleries?
This is in a rather central location for everyone.

Go to Saint Thomas Church, Tom's Restaurant, and the 24th NYPD precinct?
This would be on the upper west side and thus inconvenient for most people.
