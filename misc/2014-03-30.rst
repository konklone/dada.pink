This Sunday, March 30, is the anniversity of my birthday,
so something fun is going to happen.

Tom is flakey and has already changed the plans.
Now he's going to `Martha <http://www.yelp.com/biz/martha-brooklyn-5>`_,
184 DeKalb Ave at 11 am, with journalistic peoples.

We could still go to the Museum of Math at 1 pm, but I'm
thinking we should do something in Brooklyn instead not many
people seemed up for math and everyone's in Brooklyn.
