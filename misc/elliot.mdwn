Hi,

The apartment that seemed pretty nice before is now seeming less nice,
so I'm getting out of it. The person I sublet from wants me to help him
find someone else to sublet it, and if we don't manage to find someone
within a couple weeks, I'll let you just stay for free.

Some note about how I'm happy as long as it's being useful
