# Querying Tom's Craigslist database

## Install PuTTY if you're on Windows

## Generate an SSH key
If you're on Mac, GNU/Linux, or any other POSIX-like system, this should work.

    ssh-keygen

This will create a file called (probably) `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and another called
(probably) `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. The former is your private key, and the latter
is your public key.

If you're on Windows, follow
[this tutorial]()
and then add it to PuTTY.

## Make an account
Tom needs to make you an account. Send him the following.

* Your SSH public key
* The username you would like

He will make an account on his [nsa](https://the-nsa.org) server.

### What Tom needs to do to make your account.
*This is stuff that Tom needs to do; you may ignore this section if you are not Tom.*

1. Add a Unix user (`useradd $username`).
2. Put the appropriate SSH key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
3. Create the user in the database (`CREATE USER $username`).
4. Grant permissions in the database (`GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE craigslist TO $username`
    and `GRANT SELECT ON listing TO $username`).

## Log in
Once you've set up your SSH key and Tom has created the account, you'll be
able to do this.

    ssh username@tlevine.the-nsa.org 'psql craigslist'

This will put you into the postgres shell, where you can run queries.

## Running queries
Here are some ideas of queries you might run.
