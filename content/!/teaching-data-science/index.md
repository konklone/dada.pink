title: Teaching Data Science
---
I've recently been around several people who have been teaching data science in
various ways. I've always been skeptical of the utility of the educational
"data science" that I've seen, but that might be because I'm always skeptical
of schooling and of anything termed "data science". Or maybe I'm just skeptical
of everything. My distaste for the buzzterms tends to relate largely to the
semantic ambiguity of the terms, but the various related concepts tend to be
meaningful and appealing, so it is worth defining and teaching them. My
conclusion from this ramble on the utility of teaching the nebulous concept of
"data science" was that it would be nice to figure out what data science
involves and how I would teach it.



So I decided to think about how I would teach data science
