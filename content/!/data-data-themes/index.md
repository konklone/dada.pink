title: Themes in my data research about data
kind: article
---
## Premise
I've been looking at what happens when download lots of spreadsheets
(and associated metadata) and apply crude analyses across all of them
at once.

## Methods
I [download](/!/better-datasets-about-open-data/)
a bunch of spreadsheets and spreadsheet metadata from various
open data catalogs.
I then assemble all this stuff into 
[spreadsheets about spreadsheets](/!/better-datasets-about-open-data/).

[![A spreadsheet of spreadsheets](/!/dataset-as-datapoint/spreadsheet-spreadsheet.png){:.wide}](/!/dataset-as-datapoint)

Usually, each record corresponds to a full sub-spreadsheet; you could say
that I am aggregating each spreadsheet to produce a few statistics that
get put into this spreadsheet.

[![](/!/dataset-as-datapoint/dataset-features.jpg){:.wide}](/!/dataset-as-datapoint)

## Relevance
As I see it, the recent "open data" efforts have come about because we see
value in [sharing](/!/what-is-open-data/) but are not very good at it.
One person can understand what data she has and where they come from, but it's
hard to convey this understanding, even to small team that is only using a few
datasets (spreadsheets).

## Applications
In looking at all these spreadsheets, I've wound up studying how people share
data, and I've been coming up with some things to assist in the sharing of
data.

1. Better ways of searching
2. Dealing with bad (meta)data.
3. Quantifying data quality
4. Causal inferences: Do open data do anything?
