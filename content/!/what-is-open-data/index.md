title: What is open data?
---
People have said for while that I knew something about open data,
even before I started [my recent studies](/open-data), but I never
really knew what they meant. My confusion as to the meaning of the
term might actually be part of the reason why I started these
studies.

Anyway, I have a better idea now about what we really mean when
we're talking about open data. I think it's generally the phenomenon
wherein lots of people creating, sharing, and reading each other's
structured content.

## Open data in government
[This](/!/open-data-in-plain-english/) is my favorite video introduction
to the concept of open-data, at least in the context of government.

The general thought is that we can find data that can be released safely
and that releasing these data might allow new good things could happen.
And the *open* data name might be helpful in distinguishing from the
*closed* times of the past.

## Sharing data in general
Because the above video is focusing on governments who are trying to
start getting data out somewhere, it doesn't discuss more involved sorts
of sharing.  Different government departments, companies, and ordinary
people could all create their own datasets and assist in the collection
or auditing of shared datasets.

And you don't have to be a government releasing data to the public in
order to be sharing data. For example, if you use a lot of proprietary
data in an organization of at least ten people, your situation is
probably quite similar to that of this open data ecosystem. You have
enough different data sources that not everyone will know everything
about all of the data sources, so you'll come up with approaches for
[finding datasets](/!/openprism), 

As far as I can tell, open data is really just about multiple people
interacting with the same data. We call data "open" when anyone in the
world is allowed to interact with the data, but the same issues arise
even if only some people in the world are allowed to interact with the data.
