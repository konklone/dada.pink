I help people work less and think more.
I blady blah and 
partner at the [Whitby Group](http://whitbygroup.com).

## Work less
I program computers to replace existing menial human work;
I typically help organizations automate data collection and
processing tasks.

When such automation is not feasible, I design work processes,
computer interfaces and physical spaces to make the work faster,
safer and more pleasant for people.

## Think more
With the energy that I save by working less, I produce
ergonomic research and installation art that makes people
think about how their physical surroundings and behaviour
influence each other.
