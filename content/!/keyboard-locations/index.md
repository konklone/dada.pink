title: Where do people position computer keyboards?

While studying [how number pads relate to mouse locations](),
I noticed people trying to move the keyboard around. They couldn't because it
was taped to the table, but it got me thinking. Maybe people move the keyboard
a bit to the left instead of just mousing all the way to the right.

I measured the locations of computer keyboards in a computer lab for a few days
to get an idea of how they are placed. At first glance, it looks like they are
placed to the left on average and placed quite variably, but my measurement
instrument was a bit too imprecise for me to take much meaning from the numbers.
However, my qualitative impressions from looking at all of these keyboards as I
measured them match the above inferences.
