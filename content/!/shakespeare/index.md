I want to perform a play on the internet. So like on Facebook, Twitter,
FourSquare or what-have-you, and maybe linked together through Storify.

## Concept
Characters/actors post in an internet channel instead of acting on a stage.
These internet channels provide a wide variation of privacy and media,
allowing complex situations to be conveyed. Moreover, these tools have
become commonplace and each tool has its own connotations.

I got to this idea by pondering the blurring of the distinction between fiction
and reality through games that link to internet social media stuff (and
"gamification") and through movies that link to social media stuff (like those
expermiental HTML5 movies from Google).

## Proposal
Let's choose a particularly well-known play and adapt it to the internet.
Shakespeare's Hamlet seems like a good choice. How do we adapt it?

* Public gatherings happen on Twitter/YouTube/FourSquare/Facebook and so on.
* Private conversations happen on Facebook walls.
* Rumors are retweets/shares/&c.
* Monologues happen in personal blogs.
* Travel is manifest through the location field on these various sites.
* The playwright could assemble these interactions in a Storify.

You'll note that some of these are private places that only a select group can
see. Actors will use their real accounts rather than creating new accounts for
their characters. The audience will be embedded within the performance,
experiencing it from different perspectives based on their existing connections
with the actors.
