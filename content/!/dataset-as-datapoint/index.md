<!-- For the winter issue of Socrata's magazine -->
I've recently been collecting and studying
[data about open data](/open-data).

## Data set as data point
The inspiration for all of these studies is the idea that
any collection of things could be seen as data to be analyzed.

Specifically, even a collection of datasets could be treated
as a dataset of datasets, with a record for each particular
dataset.

## Metadata as data
The term "metadata" is sort of funny. Metadata are data about
data, but they're still data, so do we really need another term
for it? In studying metadata about 100,000 datasets, I started
to see what it means. When people talk about "metadata", they're
usually thinking of information that you'd use for cataloging
and framing the data rather than stuff that you would do "data
analysis" on. Of course, it doesn't have to be this way.

When we see datasets as data points, we see metadata as data.
Inside of our collection of datasets, we have a record for each
sub-dataset; and inside each record, we have a bunch of
fields/attributes/variables about the dataset. What fields
should go in there? The metadata fields are a pretty good place
to start.

## Creating new dataset features
Another thing about metadata is that they are usually recorded
separately of the data; they're
