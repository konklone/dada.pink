title: How to make a personal website, in 9001 easy steps
---
Making your own personal website might seem daunting, but
it's not hard if you break it into smaller steps.

## Recording your works
Start recording everything worth recording. Write
it down, take video, or whatever. It doesn't matter how
you do it or how you organize things; just record things
while you still remember them, and store them in a place
you won't lose them. (Email attachments are perfectly
acceptable.)

Before I had a good system, I stored things in email
attachments, Google Docs, hard drives, Gitorious (git
repositories), Tumblr, SmugMug, S3, Twitter, Facebook,
and probably other places.

## Organizing your works
Nobody other than you is going to read your website once
you have it, at least at first, so don't worry about
designing it for other people. In fact, you don't even need
a website; just come up with some system that makes it
easy for you to find the things you've recorded.

If you've been using email attachments to store your works,
you could just list the names of the works and search terms
that will find them. I actually didn't do this, but the point
is that it doesn't have to be fancy.

![Example]()

Most of my things were already publically accessible on the web,
so I mostly made a list of all of the links to them. I did this
as a [webpage](),
but you could do it in an email or blog post or whatever.

## Get them into files on a filesystem
If you've been storing them as ordinary files, copy them
into a new place with standard naming conventions. I suggest
the following structure.

    things-i-did/name-of-thing/file-about-thing

For example,

    things-i-did/middle-names/graph.png
    things-i-did/middle-names/census-email.txt


Lots of blog
software suggests a structure like this.

    /posts/this-cool-thing.html
    /posts/that-cool-thing.html

I went with a slightly different structure.

    /posts/this-cool-thing/index.html
    /posts/that-cool-thing/index.html

This structure is nice because it gives me a place to put more
than one file per page.

    /posts/this-cool-thing/index.html
    /posts/this-cool-thing/picture-of-thing.jpg
    /posts/that-cool-thing/index.html
    /posts/that-cool-thing/ugh-microsoft-word.docx
