Thomas Levine is a dada artist who
[whimsically moves](https://github.com/tlevine/pal-public/blob/master/current)
now that his apartment fits in a [small suitcase](/!/stuff-2014-02).
He seems to be curious about why people do things.

Playing with computers since he was young, Tom eventually developed back and
wrist pain, so he started studying ergonomics. And his back and wrists now hurt less.
He has recently been playing [music](/music), [teaching](/teaching) data things,
and studying [how people share spreadsheets](/open-data).

I have this crazy dream where I can dada all day, afford to eat,
and still have time to sleep. Please consider donating to me if you find
my dada worthwhile.

[Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/thomaslevine) is an easy way to donate money.
Since I'm so mobile, I also accept donations of sleeping quarters;
[email me](mailto:_@thomaslevine.com) about that.
