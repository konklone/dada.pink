## About this site
Tom didn't put much thought into this site; it works decently for him, but
other people seem to have lots of trouble finding things on it, particularly
his email address.

Thomas Levine reads the text before images and he doesn't really pay attention
to images unless he is explicitly told to do so, so he has avoided putting many
images on the site.
