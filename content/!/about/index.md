title: About Thomas Levine
---

## Short version

Data science, ergonomics,
typography, toilets, data
gastronomy, free software,
pretend-ironic buzzwords
and the color pink.

## Complicated version

Thomas Levine likes to help peole make things work more smoothly. When he was a
young child, he built assembly lines for fun. He only realized that this was
weird in college as he was refactoring a process for piling snow onto a snow
fort. Tom apparently knows how to improve human processes, and that's nice, but
he recently has found it easier to replace them entirely with computers.

While it's nice that Tom can make things more efficient, he suspects that
improving efficiency is more efficiently accomplished when he teaches other
people to make things more efficient more efficiently. Tom thinks that this
explains why he does ergonomics research and data science. (By the way, Tom
is known to do ergonomics research and data science, and he means to write
a satisfying definition of those concepts eventually.)

<!--
Consideration of the efficiency of a process involves consideration of some
costs and goals. People often select stupid costs and goals when supposedly
considering efficiency. As such, the word "efficiency" isn't particularly
helpful for describing what Tom likes; it's just the best word that he could
come up with. Someone said something that may appear to contradict Tom's
supposed preference for efficiency.

## Other things

Tom sees no distinction between work and play.

He [plays spreadsheets](http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130429/greenpoint/data-driven-band-csv-soundsystem-makes-music-from-spreadsheets)
in a band called [CSV Soundsystem](http://csvsoundsystem.com).

He would not do well in Fight Club.

He has superpowers.

And he's strange in other ways.

## About this site

Tom didn't put much thought into this site beyond the selection of colors;
it works decently for him, but other people seem to have lots of trouble
finding things on it, particularly his email address.

Thomas Levine reads the text before images and he doesn't really pay attention
to images unless he is explicitly told to do so, so he has avoided putting many
images on the site.
