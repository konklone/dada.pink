![A picture of Tom from when he had pink hair](/img/me.png){:style="background-color: inherit;"}

Playing with computers since he was young, Tom eventually developed back and
wrist pain, so he started studying ergonomics and conducting quantitative
ergonomics research. At some point, people started calling him a data scientist.
And his back and wrists now hurt less. He recently been playing music with
[csv soundsystem](http://csvsoundsystem.com) and studying how people publish
and use [open data](/open-data).
