I know enough about "data science" that people
[ask me for advice](http://datakind.org/2012/08/data-heroes-tom-levine/)
about it. I also know something about "ergonomics".

I don't normally work with "big data", unless you define them as "data that don't
[fit in Excel](http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2012/07/31/do-all-analysts-use-excel/)",
but I'd know what to do if I had such a properly enormous dataset.
