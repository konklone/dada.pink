title: Big Data Ergonomics

I know enough about "data science" that people
[ask me for advice](http://datakind.org/2012/08/data-heroes-tom-levine/)
about it. I also know something about "ergonomics".

I don't normally work with "big data", unless you define them as "data that don't
[fit in Excel](http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2012/07/31/do-all-analysts-use-excel/)",
but I'd know what to do if I had such a properly enormous dataset.

I remarked one day that there was no "big data ergonomics", so I decided to
invent it. But what would it be? Ergonomics already uses "data", so the
emphasis here is on "big" rather than "data".

Without trying to define "ergonomics", (The concept is as nebulous as "big data"
and "data science".) let's say for now that ergonomics, or at least the aspect
that interests me, tends to study human phenomena with small effects and long-term
consequences. This includes making things easier to use, studying/reducing
repetitive strain injuries, finding ways to work more productively and safely,
and sizing and otherwise adapting objects for different people.
