title: Big Data Ergonomics

I know enough about "data science" that people
[ask me for advice](http://datakind.org/2012/08/data-heroes-tom-levine/)
about it. I also know something about "ergonomics".

I don't normally work with "big data", unless you define them as "data that don't
[fit in Excel](http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2012/07/31/do-all-analysts-use-excel/)",
but I'd know what to do if I had such a properly enormous dataset.

I remarked one day that there was no "big data ergonomics", so I decided to
invent it. But what would it be? Ergonomics already uses "data", so the
emphasis here is on "big" rather than "data".

## What would "big data ergonomics" be?
Without trying to define "ergonomics", (The concept is as nebulous as "big data"
and "data science".) let's say for now that ergonomics, or at least the aspect
that interests me, tends to study human phenomena with small effects and long-term
consequences. This includes making things easier to use, studying/reducing
repetitive strain injuries, finding ways to work more productively and safely,
and sizing and otherwise adapting objects for different people.

Regardless of how you define them, "big data" will have way more observations
than small data. "Big data" thus have larger sample sizes, and they
also might be more representative of some population because they might be
spread out more frequently and continuously over time and might involve more
random sampling.

Ergonomics is already using "small data" in the form of lab studies,
questionnaires and other observations by people. If we replaced the human
observers with computers, we could collect some "big data".

It sounds like "big data" would solve some of these "ergonomics" problems quite
well; ergonomics would like to study small effects over long periods of time.
A large sample (or better, a population) might help us tease out small effects,
and collection over a long time-span might help us see long-term impacts of
interventions of ergonomic interest.

## Demonstration of the concept
I wanted to make something that would explain my concept of "big data ergonomics"
and see whether it made sense.
