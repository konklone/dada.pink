## Choosing an email address
Since I can have any address at thomaslevine.com,
I've had a hard time choosing one. There's a fun,
long story about previous email addresses, and I
can explain that some other time. Anyway, I've
changed my email address yet again. Here it is.

<blockquote id="e-post">
<noscript>dot at thomaslevine dot com</noscript>

## Validity
Usually, websites are fine with whatever new email address
I come up with, but this time, they don't like it.

When I try to change my email address in
[Facebook](https://facebook.com/perluette),
it says I "must provide a valid email."

!["You must provide a valid email." error message](facebook.png){:.wide}

It works on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thomaslevine).

!["A confirmation email was sent" success message](twitter.png){:.wide}

[Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/perluette) says it's "not a valid email format".
