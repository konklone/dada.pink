Since I can have any address at thomaslevine.com,
I've had a hard time choosing one. Actually, I have
a bunch of them that all forward to the same place.

(link somewhere else?)

I just made this email address.

<blockquote id="e-post">
<noscript>dot at thomaslevine dot com</noscript>
</blockquote>

Interestingly, lots of people don't like it.

When I try to change my email address in
[Facebook](https://facebook.com/perluette),
it says I "must provide a valid email."

It works on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thomaslevine).

[Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/perluette) says it's "not a valid email format".
