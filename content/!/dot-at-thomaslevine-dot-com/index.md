## Choosing an email address
Since I can have any address at thomaslevine.com,
I've had a hard time choosing one. There's a fun,
long story about previous email addresses, and I
can explain that some other time. Anyway, I've
changed my email address yet again. Here it is.

<noscript>dot at thomaslevine dot com</noscript>

## Validity
Most websites are fine with this new email address,
but some don't like it.

It works in [Mailman](http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/).

!["A confirmation message has been sent..." message](mailman.png)

When I try to change my email address in
[Facebook](https://facebook.com/perluette),
it says I "must provide a valid email."

!["You must provide a valid email." error message](facebook.png){:.wide}

It works on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thomaslevine).

!["A confirmation email was sent" success message](twitter.png){:.wide}

[Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/perluette) says it's "not a valid email format".

[Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) says it "isn't correct".

[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) let's me update my email address just fine.
