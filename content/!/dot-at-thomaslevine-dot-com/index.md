Since I can have any address at thomaslevine.com,
I've had a hard time choosing one. Actually, I have
a bunch of them that all forward to the same place.

(link somewhere else?)

I just made this email address.

![dot at thomaslevine dot com]()

Interestingly, lots of people don't like it.



My email provider, [Gandi](),
....


When I try to change my email address in
[Facebook](),
it says I "must provide a valid email."

![]()

It works on [Twitter]().

![]()

[Pinterest]() says it's "not a valid email format".
