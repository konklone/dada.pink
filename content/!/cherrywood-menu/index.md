The smoothies section of this menu from Cherrywood Coffeehouse is designed for both beginners and intermediates; beginners immediately see the five smoothie choices at the top and intermediates know to look at the bottom to "design [their] own". Experts surely order things that aren’t on the menu.

![Menu says "Smoothies", lists five types of smoothies, then has a "Design your own" section.](<%= item.identifier %>menu.jpg)

If you don’t know what I’m talking about when I discuss beginners, intermediates and experts, read Cooper & Reimann.
