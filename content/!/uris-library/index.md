Library administration at Cornell University recognized that one library's
main reading room was always empty while the one across the street was always
full. Tal Gluck and I tried to figure out why.

We established functions and user groups for this reading room and then
compared the library to other similar libraries. We conducted interviews with
members of different the user groups, observed the space several times, read
some relevant literature. Based on all this, we also composed a questionnaire
and distributed it to people in several Cornell libraries.

We identified key environmental qualities that may be contributing to the
decreased use of the Dean Room. We also had some thoughts about how people use
libraries in general.

If you dare, you can also take a look at the
[questionnaire](questionnaire.pdf) and its [resulting data](questionnaire-data.csv).
Here's a [summary](questionnaire-summary.pdf) of the data.
