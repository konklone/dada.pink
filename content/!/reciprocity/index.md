One day last year in Chicago, I was about to catch a bus when I realized
that my smallest denomination of currency was a $5 bill. Since the buses
only take exact change, I looked around for a way to break it. I asked a
person who was waiting for the bus with me if she could break it, and she
said she didn't have change.

When the bus came, she started walking towards the same bus I was walking
towards. She was a bit further from the bus, so I got on first.

I told the bus driver that the $5 was for both of us, and then I promptly
walked to the back of the bus, still a few yards ahead of the other person.

Shortly after I sat down, this person made her way to the back of the bus,
gave me two dollars and then found an empty seat towards the middle of the bus.

This person went slightly out of her way to pay me for the bus ride that
I gave her. Reciprocity is cool.
