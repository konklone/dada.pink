It always seems like everyone doing computer stuff is a 25-year-old
prodigy who is changing the world in the most important way possible.
It took me a while to realize this because everyone's really good at
pretending that he knows what he's doing. But once I realized that,
I started wondering why this is. And here are my conclusions.

Especially at this age, people want to feel like they have a place
in society. Having an important job is a pretty easy way to feel like
you're playing a part in society. So people dedicate their lives to
some silly thing that doesn't pay. Or they go to school and spend
money.
