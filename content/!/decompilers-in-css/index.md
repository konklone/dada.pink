I wrote
[CSV](https://github.com/tlevine/csv.css),
[markdown](http://openprism.thomaslevine.com/), and
[LaTeX](https://github.com/tlevine/html2tex)
decompilers in CSS.

And now the tables on thomaslevine.com are styled as CSVs!

column1 | column2 | column3
--------|---------|--------
      1 |       2 |       3
      4 |       5 |       6
