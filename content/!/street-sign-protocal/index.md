Someone recently asked me to explain what a computer "protocal" is.
This is one of those words that sounds more special than it is; you
could just-as-accurately call it a language or an expectation.

## The street sign protocal 
To make that more clear, I'll document a protocal that we might not
usually think of a protocal. Let's call it the Street Sign Protocal
(SSP).

To keep things simple, I'll actually document a simple version of the
Street Sign Protocal. Let's call it the Simple Street Sign Protocal (SSSP).

### Specification
SSSP is a way of exchanging the names of *streets*. It involves
*street signs* mounted on *poles* near the *corners* of
*four-way intersections*. Let's define these terms.

* A *street* is a paved public thoroughfare in a built environment.
    (This definition is taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street).)
* A *four-way intersection* is a place where two streets cross.
    Its shape is approximately a rectangle, with one side having the
    width of one street and the other side having the width of the
    other street.
* Being rectangular, a four-way intersection has four *corners* at the
    usual places.
* A *pole* is a long cylinder sticking out of the ground.
* A *street sign* is a flat thing that has text on it and gets mounted
    on a pole.

Next, let's discuss what is expected of all of these components.

#### Pole
Each four-way intersection has four corners, and each pole is associated with
a corner of an intersection. Each corner must have zero or one poles, and at least
one of the corners of a four-way intersection must have a pole; thus, an
intersection must have between one and four poles.

Poles must be mounted within about ten feet of a corner of the intersection
but not on the paved area of the street or the intersection. (It is okay for them
to be mounted on the sidewalk.)
