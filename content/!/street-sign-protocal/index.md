To make that more clear, I'll document a protocal that we might not
usually think of a protocal. Let's call it the Street Sign Protocal
(SSP).

To keep things simple, I'll actually document a simple version of the
Street Sign Protocal. Let's call it the Simple Street Sign Protocal (SSSP).

*street signs* mounted on *poles* or *buildings* near the *corners* of
*four-way intersections*. Let's define these terms.

    (This definition is taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street).)
* A *four-way intersection* is a place where two streets cross.
    Its shape is approximately a rectangle, with one side having the
    width of one street and the other side having the width of the
    other street.
* Being rectangular, a four-way intersection has four *corners* at the
    usual places.
* 

If a street sign is are mounted on building, the buildings should be
