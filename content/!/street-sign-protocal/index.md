Someone recently asked me to explain what a computer "protocal" is.
This is one of those words that sounds more special than it is; you
could just-as-accurately call it a language or an expectation.

## The street sign protocal 
To make that more clear, I'll document a protocal that we might not
usually think of a protocal. Let's call it the Street Sign Protocal
(SSP).

To keep things simple, I'll actually document a simple version of the
Street Sign Protocal. Let's call it the Simple Street Sign Protocal (SSSP).

### Specification
SSSP is a way of exchanging the names of *streets*. It involves
*street signs* mounted on *poles* near the *corners* of
*four-way intersections*. Let's define these terms.

* A *street* is a paved public thoroughfare in a built environment.
    (This definition is taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street).)
* A *four-way intersection* is a place where two streets cross.
    Its shape is approximately a rectangle, with one side having the
    width of one street and the other side having the width of the
    other street.
* Being rectangular, a four-way intersection has four *corners* at the
    usual places.
* A *pole* is a long cylinder sticking out of the ground.
* A *street sign* is a flat rectangular thing that has text on both sides.

Next, let's discuss what is expected of all of the.

Each four-way intersection has four corners, and each pole is associated with
a corner of an intersection. Each corner must have zero or one poles, and at least
one of the corners of a four-way intersection must have a pole; thus, an
intersection must have between one and four poles.

Poles must be mounted within about ten feet of a corner of the intersection
but not on the paved area of the street or the intersection. (It is okay for them
to be mounted on the sidewalk.) It must stick straight out of the ground; the long
axis of the cylinder must be approximately in line with the direction of gravity.

The street sign must include the name of the street in very large text. This name
must be written on both sides of the sign and must be especially easy to see, even
at night.

Street signs are mounted on poles, each pole having exactly two street signs.
The street signs must be aligned in a particular way.
