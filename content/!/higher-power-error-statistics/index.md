Let's say we have a bunch of numbers, represented by the tick marks towards
the bottom the fancy interactive chart drawing thingy below. Next, we chose
some other number, represented by the big red bar that you can drag.

We can draw squares whose 

<div id="viz" style='width: 640px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'></div>
<small>
  Nota bene: The line and square at the bottom right are *proportional* to but
  *not equal* to the sums of lines and squares, respectively.
