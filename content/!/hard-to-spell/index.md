title: Words that are hard to spell

I previously used "(es)perluette" as my name in a bunch of places. (It's a
French word for "ampersand".) As such, people who didn't know French wouldn't
understand what I was saying when I verbally told them my email address. And
I would always have to write it out for them.

I decided to change my email address to a word with the reverse properties,
to a word that would be easy to understand aurally but difficult to spell.
I wound up with "occurrence". Here are some other ideas.

* pamphlet
* accidentally
* definitely
