title: My personal computer infrastructure
---

This is the architecture that runs my various sites and other services

Here is most of the hardware.

* My office houses a Beaglebone cluster, called "cluster", my main
    workstation, called "desk", and sometimes my Lenovo IdeaPad Y560,
    called "laptop".
* I have three small virtual private servers hosted at Prometeus.
    Call these watermelon, honeydew and mango.
* A bunch of websites and backups are stored on Amason S3.
* Incremental backups of private things go to Tarsnap.
* I access all of these through a dumb terminal, typically my Chromebook.
