title: Do all "analysts" use Excel?
---

We were wondering how common spreadsheets are as a platform for data analysis.
It's not something I've really thought about in a while; I find it way easier
to clean numbers with real programming languages. But we suspected that virtually
everyone else used spreadsheets, and specifically Excel Spreadsheet, so we
did a couple of things to check that.

First, I looked for job postings for "analyst" jobs. I specifically looked in
companies that provide tools or analysis for social media stuff. For each posting,
I marked whether the posting require knowledge of Excel. They **all** did.
And not only did they require knowledge of Excel, they required "Excellent
computer skills, especially with Excel", "Advanced Excel skills a must", and
so on. I generally felt that Excel was presented as the most important skill
for each particular job.

Second, I

to ask "analyst" friends whether they use anything other than Excel.

  Thomas Levine posted the Facebook status "I'm wondering how common Excel is.
  If you work as an 'analyst', could you tell me whether you do your analysis
  in anything other than Excel?", and two of his friends commented saying,
  quite strongly, that they use Excel a lot.

It seems that they don't.
