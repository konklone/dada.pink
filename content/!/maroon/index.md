    Hi everyone,

    All of you expressed interest in joining the Maroon staff, and the
    time has come to fill out the those applications (attached).  They're 
    relatively painless and self-explanatory; if you have any questions,
    feel free to ask us.  They're due Monday and more details are on the
    sheet.  Thanks!

    Katie and Ardevan
