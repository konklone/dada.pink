title: Curriculum vitae
---
I wonder what the point of a CV is. If I'm not doing the conventional
academic thing, I don't really need the typical CV. But why is it desireable?
To some degree, it's a summary of a person. But my website is a summary
of me too and it ignores some typical contents of a CV....

I think a CV is intended to make someone sound impressive. I sort
of don't like doing that, but I'm curious about what it would sound like,
so here I go.
