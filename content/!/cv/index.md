title: Curriculum vitae
---
I wonder what the point of a CV is. If I'm not doing the conventional
academic thing, I don't really need the typical CV. But why is it desireable?
To some degree, it's a summary of a person. But my website is a summary
of me too and it ignores some typical contents of a CV....

I think a CV is intended to make someone sound impressive. I sort
of don't like doing that, but I'm curious about what it would sound like,
so here I go.

## Long-term gigs
* I was on the development team at [ScraperWiki](https://scraperwiki.com),
    where I helped design and build data processing systems and infrastructures.
    I also taught courses on the cleaning and analysis of data. (2012)
* I collected data about the locations of finance institutions in South
    Africa (primarily) to assist the
    [Microfinance Information Exchange](http://mixmarket.org) with
    [mapping the financial sector](http://www.themix.org/publications/mix-microfinance-world/2012/05/mapping-financial-sector-south-africa).
    They use these data to understand who has access to financial products
    in order that people make more informed investment decisions regarding microfinance. (2012)
* I developed and continue to maintain a system that streamlines
    environmental advocacy efforts of the
    [Gulf Restoration Network](https://healthygulf.org/). (2012--present)
* I conducted early data engineering on the [DataPad](http://datapad.io)
    data analysis product. (2013)
* I developed the curriculum for [Zipfian Academy](http://zipfianacademy.com)
    and taught the first class of students. (2013)
* As part of the hacker collective [csv soundsystem](http://csvsoundsystem.com).
    I did engineering and product management on [treasury.io](http://treasury.io). (2013)
