I regularly discuss computation at
[lectures in offices followed by beer in loud bars](http://www.meetup.com),
but this gets boring. I would like some other setting. Here are ideas.

## Maze traversal
Meet at a corn maze, then break into groups. Each group starts at the beginning
and follows a different maze solving algorithm.

## Person-clustering
Meet somewhere in Central Park, then spread out. Don't spread out randomly;
choose a nice place to sit or stand or do yoga or whatever. After everyone
has spread out, apply some clustering algorithm. (In choosing the algorithm,
consider that Euclidean physical length is not the only distance measure.)
As you form clusters, consider talking about why you chose to sit in the
same part of the park.

## Dining philosophers
Meet at an Italian restaurant and sit down at a table. Everyone orders
spaghetti. The forks are interspersed between the bowls of spaghetti, like
on any other night.

Everyone must spend her time either thinking or eating. In order to eat,
someone must pick up both the fork to her left and the fork to her right.
When she is done eating, she puts them down.

Everyone follows a concurrent algorithm. The algorithms are switched every
few minutes so that people can see different algorithms.

## Maximization
Meet somewhere in Central Park, then split off into small groups. Each group
randomly selects a different location in the park from a map and goes to that
location. The group follows some algorithm to search for the highest point in
the park. Or maybe just a local high point. When it's done with that algorithm,
it selects a new random point and a new algorithm.
