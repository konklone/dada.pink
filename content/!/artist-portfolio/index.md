I recently noticed that everything I cared about in my apartment
fit in a suitcase and a backpack. I think I can get it down to an
artist portfolio and a backpack. Here's what goes in the artist
portfolio and how it all fits.

## Objects
When I'm walking around day to day, I use the artist portfolio
as my ordinary carrying case. In this situation, the portfolio
will contain some writing implements, some paper, and whatever
else I need for the day (outer-clothes, laptop computer, &c.).

When I'm moving all of my things, I use the artist portfolio for
the things that don't fit in the backpack. These things are

* Paper
* A [27" monitor](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824005419)
* A table top (for my [desk](/!/desk)) made of

## How they fit
The following thinking figures no styrofoam thingy.

The table top has a top and bottom; the bottom is the side to which
leg stubs are glued.
The monitor screen touches the bottom of the table top; the table top
protects the screen from impacts.

The paper goes on top of the desk. (The complete order is paper, table
top, monitor.) This adds some protection for the monitor, but it's
mainly to protect the paper; this is the only place were the paper can be
up against a very flat surface.

All gaps in the case get filled in by clothing.

## Portfolio specifications

### Dimensions
The case needs to be deep enough to fit everything and long and
wide enough to fit the monitor. The monitor is 25.3" by 15.4" by 1.9".
It'll have to be a little deeper than this to accomodate the
paper and table top and a little longer or wider to accomodate the
table leg stubs.

### Sturdiness
The only fragile thing in the portfolio is the monitor, and it
will be protected by the table top, the paper, and the styrofoam
thingy (if I choose to use that), so the portfolio case itself
doesn't need to be very sturdy. I could thus save some weight and
money, perhaps, by choosing a more basic case.
