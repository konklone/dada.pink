I recently noticed that everything I cared about in my apartment
fit in a suitcase and a backpack. I think I can get it down to an
artist portfolio and a backpack. Here's what goes in the artist
portfolio and how it all fits.

## Objects
When I'm walking around day to day, I use the artist portfolio
as my ordinary carrying case. In this situation, the portfolio
will contain some writing implements, some paper, and whatever
else I need for the day (outer-clothes, laptop computer, &c.).

When I'm moving all of my things, I use the artist portfolio for
the things that don't fit in the backpack. These things are

* Paper
* A [27" monitor](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824005419)
* Maybe the styrofoam thingy to protect the monitor screen
* A table top (for my [desk](/!/desk)) made of
* A [folding chair](http://www.bjindustriesinc.com/backjack-chairs.htm), possibly

## How they fit


## Portfolio specifications

### Dimensions
The case needs to be 

### Sturdiness
The only fragile thing in the portfolio is the monitor, and it
will be protected by the table top, the paper, and the styrofoam
thingy (if I choose to use that), so the portfolio case itself
doesn't need to be very sturdy. I could thus save some weight and
money, perhaps, by choosing a more basic case.
