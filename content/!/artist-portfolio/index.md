I recently noticed that everything I cared about in my apartment
fit in a suitcase and a backpack. I think I can get it down to an
artist portfolio and a backpack. Here's what goes in the artist
portfolio and how it all fits.

## Objects
When I'm walking around day to day, I use the artist portfolio
as my ordinary carrying case. In this situation, the portfolio
will contain some writing implements, some paper, and whatever
else I need for the day (outer-clothes, laptop computer, &c.).

When I'm moving all of my things, I use the artist portfolio for
the things that don't fit in the backpack. These things are

* Paper
* A [27" monitor](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824005419)
* A table top (for my [desk](/!/desk)) made of
* A [folding chair](http://www.bjindustriesinc.com/backjack-chairs.htm), possibly
