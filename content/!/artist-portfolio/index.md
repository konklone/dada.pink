I recently noticed that everything I cared about in my apartment
fit in a suitcase and a backpack. I think I can get it down to an
artist portfolio and a backpack. Here's what goes in the artist
portfolio and how it all fits.

## Objects
When I'm walking around day to day, I use the artist portfolio
as my ordinary carrying case. In this situation, the portfolio
will contain some writing implements, some paper, and whatever
else I need for the day (outer-clothes, laptop computer, &c.).

When I'm moving all of my things, I use the artist portfolio for
the things that don't fit in the backpack. These things are

* Paper
* A [27" monitor](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824005419)
* Maybe the styrofoam thingy to protect the monitor screen
* A table top (for my [desk](/!/desk)) made of
* A [folding chair](http://www.bjindustriesinc.com/backjack-chairs.htm), possibly

## How they fit
The following thinking figures no styrofoam thingy.

The table top has a top and bottom; the bottom is the side to which
leg stubs are glued.
The monitor screen touches the bottom of the table top; the table top
protects the screen from impacts.

The folding chair goes behind the monitor, so the order is now table top,
monitor, chair. The leg stubs on the table top are tall enough to extend
past the back-most part of the monitor, and they are positioned such that
the chair touches them rather than the monitor. Thus, the chair protects
the back of the monitor.

The paper goes on top of the desk. (The complete order is paper, table
top, monitor, chair.) This adds some protection for the monitor, but it's
mainly to protect the paper; this is the only place were the paper can be
up against a very flat surface.

All gaps in the case get filled in by clothing.

## Portfolio specifications

### Dimensions
The case needs to be deep enough to fit everything and long and
wide enough to fit the monitor. The monitor is 25.3" by 15.4" by 1.9".

It would also be nice if it could fit in as an airplane carry-on
item. That is, it should be less than 45 linear inches (easy) and
fit in the carry-on bag check thingy, which is 22" by 14" by 9".
That won't work with the present monitor. :(

Given that it isn't going to fit in carryon, it might be fun just
to go for the biggest thing I can, in all dimensions. Though maybe
it would be nice for the depth dimension to collapse a bit.

On the other hand, I find that my big notebooks have been a bit too
big, so maybe I'll try to go for just big enough.

The main difficulty with sizing will be finding a portfolio case
that is deep enough. Hmm maybe I can put the chair in my backpack
instead; then I'd only need a 2"-deep portfolio.

### Sturdiness
The only fragile thing in the portfolio is the monitor, and it
will be protected by the table top, the paper, and the styrofoam
thingy (if I choose to use that), so the portfolio case itself
doesn't need to be very sturdy. I could thus save some weight and
money, perhaps, by choosing a more basic case.
