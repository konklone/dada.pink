## "Data" means "table"
I don't really like to distinguish between data and anything else
because [everything is data to me](/!/world-data-world). But I sort
of do make a distinction, and here it is.

> Data are things in data tables

Once we express the world in data tables, we can study it with a
wide body of analytical tools that expect data to be in tables.
When we work with tables so much, we come up with lots of fancy
words to describe all of the different parts of a table.

## Rows and columns
Here's a data table.

It has a grid with a value in each of the rectangular boxes.
Being this sort of grid, it has columns and rows. These columns
and rows mean special things.

## Rows
The very first line in that table says "id, location, ...".
This line is called the "header", and we'll get to that later.

The rest of the lines are all *rows*.
A data table represents a collection of things, and each individual
thing is represented as a row. For example, this table is about a
collection of XXX, so each row is a XXX.

It is quite important to know that each row is a XXX, so we have a
name for this relationship; we say that XXX is the the *statistical unit*
in this data table.
