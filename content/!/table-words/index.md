## "Data" means "table"
I don't really like to distinguish between data and anything else
because [everything is data to me](/!/world-data-world). But I sort
of do make a distinction, and here it is.

> Data are things in data tables

Once we express the world in data tables, we can study it with a
wide body of analytical tools that expect data to be in tables.
When we work with tables so much, we come up with lots of fancy
words to describe all of the different parts of a table.

## Varibles and records
Here's a data table.

It has a grid with a value in each of the rectangular boxes.
Being this sort of grid, it has columns and rows. These columns
and rows mean special things.
