I was quite impressed by the
[resource list](http://newshackdays.pbworks.com/w/page/53777325/FrontPage)
that we developed in advance of the weekend; I think it'll be rather useful in
itself.

## Friday
We had our scraping tutorial on Friday morning. The turnout was pretty good.

If you are jealous about your non-attendance, you can take a look at the
[video](foo) and the [slides](slides).

After a tasty lunch aoshaoeust, we stahue into eight groups, nominally to
work on particular projects, but more to fiddle around and hang out.

Michael, Michael, John and I hovered around helping various groups.
One group was looking at a particular table in proxy statements, so I
had some fun pulling that table out with them. One person had come across
some Microsoft Access databases of San Francisco health inspections
posted online. We looked into ways of converting them to more convenient
table formats and pondered things to do with them. I really want someone
to post all of the health inspection reports on Yelp or Foursquare.

One group huddled in the corner and then announced at the end that they
had managed to extract quotes from press releases with bearable reliability.
They continued working on this over the rest of the weekend.
