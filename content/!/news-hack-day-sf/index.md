Indulge me as I brag about what I did two weekends ago at
[News Hack Day SF](http://newshackdaysf.tumblr.com).

## Before the weekend

I arrived in San Francisco on Tuesday and stayed with a friend in his
crazy warehouse in Oakland until Thursday.

On Thursday, Brittney and I prepared some things for the Friday at the Chronicle.
We had lunch at a hilarious diner.

Look at their authentic retro wifi.

And the waitresses take orders on iPads.
It's like they had to go over-the-top with the dinerness in order that the
internet access and iPads would be acceptable.
And the food was quite awesome.

I stayed the rest of the nights at the StartupHouse. That was rather crazy as well
(in a different sense than the converted warehouse sense).

## Friday
We had our scraping tutorial on Friday morning. The turnout was pretty good.

If you are jealous about your non-attendance, you can take a look at the
[video](foo) and the [slides](slides).

After a tasty lunch aoshaoeust, we stahue into eight groups, nominally to
work on particular projects, but more to fiddle around and hang out.

Michael, Michael, John and I hovered around helping various groups.
One group was looking at a particular table in proxy statements, so I
had some fun pulling that table out with them. One person had come across
some Microsoft Access databases of San Francisco health inspections
posted online. We looked into ways of converting them to more convenient
table formats and pondered things to do with them. I really want someone
to post all of the health inspection reports on Yelp or Foursquare.

One group huddled in the corner and then announced at the end that they
had managed to extract quotes from press releases with bearable reliability.
They continued working on this over the rest of the weekend.

I was quite impressed by the
[resource list](http://newshackdays.pbworks.com/w/page/53777325/FrontPage)
that we developed in advance of the weekend; I think it'll be rather useful in
itself.
