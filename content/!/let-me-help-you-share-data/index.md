As you may have realized, I've recently been [studying](/open-data)
data about open data so that we can use data to drive our opening of
data. It has been more fun than many other things I've done, and I
want to keep doing this research all day. So now I'm looking for work
that will allow that. If anything below sounds interesting to you or
if you think you have something interesting that I haven't thought of,
email me at [\_@thomaslevine.com](mailto:_@thomaslevine.com).

## What I really mean when I talk about open data
If you're calling your activities "open data", they're probably going
to be interesting to me. On the other hand, a lot of other scenarios
have similar characteristics; for example, if you use a lot of proprietary data
in an organization of more than a few people, your situation is
probably quite similar to that of this open data ecosystem.

As far as I can tell, open data is really just about multiple people
interacting with the same data. We call data "open" when anyone in the
world is allowed to interact with the data, but the same issues arise
even if only some people in the world are allowed to interact with the data.

## Things I can do for you
There are a lot of things about open data that I want to look at,
and they can be aligned with quite a many different efforts/organizations.

* If you work for a software company, I can prototype or implement new
    features in your product to make open data better.
* If you work for an organization that wants to release open data
    or share data internally,
    I can quantify how well your efforts are going, figure out what's
    working, and find ways of making things go better.
* If you are giving grants in relation to open data, we should talk.
* It might be that you find my stuff useful but don't have any work
    specific to you that they want me to do. I have a long list of things
    that I want to do, and I can prioritize them somewhat based on what
    would be most useful to you.

I want to do lots of different small projects around this, so a
consulting arrangement is probably what I'm looking for.
