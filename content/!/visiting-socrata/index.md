title: I visit Socrata

I want knowledge to be shared. I did this and that and that other thing.
Blah blah blah.
It makes sense that I would care about open data.
But never used for practical purpose
So maybe I'm more interested in the sharing of knowledge.

## Hackathons
Only ever used open data at hackathons.
Never for practical thing.
About hackathons....
Useful for meeting people, but don't expect sustained stuff

## Apps
At the first hackathon for the [NYC Big Apps](http://nycbigapps.com/)
competition, [Ashley Williams](http://heyashleyashley.com) and I started
talking about hackathons and how no useful software would probably come
out of that hackathon. Moreover, we thought we could algorithmically
generate the apps based on the data in the data portal.

We noticed that many apps follow a search-for-things-on-a-map paradigm;
that is, you fill out a search form and get results on a map. In
[AppGen](http://appgen.me), we automated the creation of the cliche
hackathon app. We combined datasets from the New York data portal,
randomly chose a title based on the datasets' metadata, generated some
nonsense description text, randomly chose map tiles and put the data on
an app. Being cliche hackathon apps, AppGen-generated apps also broke
a month after being created.

## Portal exploration
AppGen turned out to be a decent way of exploring the data portal
and of rapidly prototyping open data apps. Putting datasets into apps
makes them a bit more tangible and less foreign. We started noticing
some issues with the datasets and composed an 
[audit](http://www.appgen.me/audit) of data portal quality.

## Dataset dataset
All of the data portals that I've seen display datasets as if they were
ordinary web pages. I thought we could do better.

In building AppGen, I wound up downloading all of the datasets on the
New York data portal. I generalized it to run on any Socrata Open Data
Portal, then I downloaded all of the metadata about all of the datasets
on 60 Socrata portals.


Over the past couple months, I've been looking at data from Socrata
data portals to study how open data is published and consumed. I've
been wondering what is in the portals, what people like, ...

And a week ago, I visited Socrata and talked about some of my findings.
