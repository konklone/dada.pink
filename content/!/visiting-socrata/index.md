title: I visit Socrata

<!--
I want knowledge to be shared. I did this and that and that other thing.
Blah blah blah.
It makes sense that I would care about open data.
But never used for practical purpose
So maybe I'm more interested in the sharing of knowledge.
-->
I recently downloaded the metadata files for all of the datasets on
60 Socrata open data portals.
Interesting stuff tends to [happen](http://thomaslevine.com/socrata)
when you do crazy things like this.

I visited Socrata in Seattle last Friday to talk about my findings and
meet everyone. But the most important part of my visit was of course
going out for teriyaki for lunch; it was so important that Chris Metcalf
sent me a Google Calendar invitation for it. They've been doing this for
about 19 months and have only missed two weeks.

## Why
Recently I did all this stuff. How did that happen?

I think most things do better when knowledge is shared,
so I obviously care about open data. I'm always excited to
hear that open data portals are expanding, but it had always
bothered me that I would never use the data on data portals.

Well that's not entirely true. I never had any particularly practical
reason to use data from open data portals, but I used some once in a
while at hackathons.
but it was only at hackathons, and nothing ever came of it. Moreover,
the only time I would ever hear of anyone using data from data portals
was at hackathons.

## Hackathons
At the first hackathon for the [NYC Big Apps](http://nycbigapps.com/)
competition, [Ashley Williams](http://heyashleyashley.com) and I started
talking about hackathons and how no useful software would probably come
out of that hackathon. Moreover, we thought we could algorithmically
generate the apps based on the data in the data portal.

## Apps
We noticed that many apps follow a search-for-things-on-a-map paradigm;
that is, you fill out a search form and get results on a map. In
[AppGen](http://appgen.me), we automated the creation of the cliche
hackathon app. We combined datasets from the New York data portal,
randomly chose a title based on the datasets' metadata, generated some
nonsense description text, randomly chose map tiles and put the data on
an app. Being cliche hackathon apps, AppGen-generated apps also broke
a month after being created.

## Portal exploration
AppGen turned out to be a decent way of exploring the data portal
and of rapidly prototyping open data apps. Putting datasets into apps
makes them a bit more tangible and less foreign. We started noticing
some issues with the datasets and composed an 
[audit](http://www.appgen.me/audit) of data portal quality.

## Dataset dataset
All of the data portals that I've seen display datasets as if they were
ordinary web pages. I thought we could do better.

In building AppGen, I wound up downloading all of the datasets on the
New York data portal. I generalized it to run on any Socrata Open Data
Portal, then I downloaded all of the metadata about all of the datasets
on 60 Socrata portals.


Over the past couple months, I've been looking at data from Socrata
data portals to study how open data is published and consumed. I've
been wondering what is in the portals, what people like, ...

And a week ago, I visited Socrata and talked about some of my findings.
