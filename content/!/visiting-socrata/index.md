title: I visit Socrata
---
I want knowledge to be shared. I did this and that and that other thing.
Blah blah blah.
It makes sense that I would care about open data.
But never used for practical purpose
So maybe I'm more interested in the sharing of knowledge.


Over the past couple months, I've been looking at data from Socrata
data portals to study how open data is published and consumed. I've
been wondering what is in the portals, what people like, ...

And a week ago, I visited Socrata and talked about some of my findings.



What I do

Why I do what I do

How that brought me to Socrata
