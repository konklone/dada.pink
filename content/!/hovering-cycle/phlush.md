## "Sitting" toilets
Western sitting-style toilets are presumably intended to be used in a seated
position, (McClelland & Ward, 1982) except when used by males for exclusively urination.
A sign on a bathroom in my college dorm illustrates this expectation.

But the word on the street is that people often adopt a hovering posture
instead of the seated posture in order to cope with unsanitary toilets.

Also, one person admitted to PostSecret that he or she hadn't sat on a toilet for the
[four years](http://www.flickr.com/photos/withinreason/2593730231/).

on PostSecret forums.)

There's even a website that reviews toilets and tells
you whether to [Sit or Squat](https://www.sitorsquat.com/).

Greed (Greed, 1995) and Moore (Moore & al, 1991) anecdotally found that young ladies
are often taught that hovering is proper and that sitting is unclean.

[WikiHow](http://www.wikihow.com/Urinate-Standing-up-As-a-Female)
[articles](http://www.wikihow.com/Safely-Use-a-Public-Bathroom)
provide examples of this phenomenon.

Formal quantitative studies have found hovering to be common among
Taiwanese people (Cai & You, 1998),
British gynaecological outpatients  (Moore & al, 1991),
and [American university students](http://thomaslevine.com/!/hovering-cycle).

## Toilets get dirty, so people hover.

The three studies I just mentioned, particularly the third (mine), also suggest that toilet
cleanliness affects posture choice, with dirtier toilets encouraging non-sitting
postures like hovering that make the toilet dirtier.

Many of the referenced forum discussions explain that hovering, rather than
sitting, creates more of a mess. Presumably, this is because hovering puts the
relevant body parts in a less stable position that is higher above the toilet,
making it harder to aim.

The discussions and formal studies indicate that people are more likely
to hover as toilets get dirtier, in order to avoid touching the dirty toilet.

Thus, the clean toilet is an unstable equilibrium of a toilet's sanitary state;
toilets get dirty, so people hover, so the toilets get dirty, so people hover.

In other contexts, this cycle is sometimes termed the
"[broken windows theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)",
or the feeling of "[maintenance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_prevention_through_environmental_design)" of a space.

## Effects of privacy on posture choice

Public toilets tend to be dirtier than private toilets, or people or we may
at least be more concerned with sanitation at public toilets than at private
toilets, so we might expect that a more public toilet would effect posture
similarly to how a more dirty toilet would.

On the other hand, privacy might have a secular impact on posture choice.
We don't have a clear idea of whether privacy affects posture choice for
reasons other than cleanliness, but here are two things that I think are
relevant.

First, social norms might have more of an impact in public toilets than in private toilets.
A lady once told me that she thought people would be more likely to hover at
public toilets because hovering is considered more proper than sitting; since
people can see others' feet and lower legs under the bathroom stalls in public
restrooms, people might be more likely to follow this convention of hovering
in public than in private.

Second, people might trust the cleanliness of toilets more when they know
who has been using it. Before I see a private toilet, I generally trust that
it is clean enough because only a specific group of people uses it. Because
these people know each other, they can shame each other if the toilet gets
dirty, so I trust somewhat that they will keep it clean. Also, if I know the
people and think that they are reasonably clean, I trust that they would keep
the bathroom clean. I do not have the same trust in a public toilet; any manner
of anonymous crazy person might have used the toilet without being compelled
to keep it clean.
