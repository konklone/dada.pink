title: The Hovering Cycle
---
Western sitting-style toilets are presumably intended to be used in a seated
position, (McClelland & Ward, 1982) except when used by males for exclusively urination.
A sign on a bathroom in my college dorm illustrates this expectation.

But the word on the street is that people often adopt a hovering posture
instead of the seated posture in order to cope with unsanitary toilets.

Also, one person admitted to PostSecret that he or she hadn't sat on a toilet for the
[four years](http://www.flickr.com/photos/withinreason/2593730231/).

on PostSecret forums.)

There's even a website that reviews toilets and tells
you whether to [Sit or Squat](https://www.sitorsquat.com/).

Greed (Greed, 1995) and Moore (Moore & al, 1991) anecdotally found that young ladies
are often taught that hovering is proper and that sitting is unclean.

[WikiHow](http://www.wikihow.com/Urinate-Standing-up-As-a-Female)
[articles](http://www.wikihow.com/Safely-Use-a-Public-Bathroom)
provide examples of this phenomenon.

Formal quantitative studies have found hovering to be common among
Taiwanese people (Cai & You, 1998),
British gynaecological outpatients  (Moore & al, 1991),
and [American university students](/!/hovering-cycle)

### Toilets get dirty, so people hover.

Many of the referenced forum discussions explain that hovering, rather than
sitting, creates more of a mess. Presumably, this is because hovering puts the
relevant body parts in a less stable position that is higher above the toilet,
making it harder to aim.

If these anecdotes about the causes and effects of hovering are correct, then
the clean toilet is an unstable equilibrium of a toilet's sanitary state;
toilets get dirty, so people hover, so the toilets get dirty, so people hover.

![Cycle of hovering and toilet cleanliness](<%= @item.identifier %>cycle.png)

In other contexts, this cycle is sometimes termed the
"[broken windows theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory)",
or the feeling of "[maintenance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_prevention_through_environmental_design)" of a space.

### Effects of privacy on posture choice

Anecdotes suggest that public toilets tend to be
dirtier than private toilets, or people or at least more concerned with
sanitation at public toilets than at private toilets  (Cai & You, 1998), so we might
expect that a more public toilet would effect posture similarly to how a more
dirty toilet would.

On the other hand, privacy might have a secular impact on posture choice.
For example, social norms might have more of an impact in public toilets than
in private toilets.

A lady once told me that she thought people would be more likely to hover at
public toilets because hovering is considered more proper than sitting; since
people can see others' feet and lower legs under the bathroom stalls in public
restrooms, people might be more likely to follow this convention of hovering
in public than in private.

### Goals
Understanding the mechanisms of toilet cleanliness can help us design and
maintain efficient toilets that people want to use, so it would be nice to
see whether this the broken windows theory explains toilet sanitation issues.

I sought to establish whether this cycle of hovering and toilet
dirt exists by looking at the postures that university students say they'd
use in toilet-use scenarios of differing privacy and cleanliness.
I was mainly concerned with how cleanliness influenced the decision
of what posture to use, but I tried to separate effects of privacy
from effects of cleanliness.

### Terms
Western toilets typically consist of a bowl and a seat with a large hole in the
middle. The seat typically can lie on the bowl or be lifted above the bowl.
I consider four categories of postures in which this contraption can be used.

#### Sitting
Sitting-style toilets are designed
to be used in a seated posture  (McClelland & Ward, 1982),
which we define as one where the buttocks or thighs touch the toilet.

#### Hovering
Hovering, also called squatting or semi-squatting, describes postures where the
feet are on the floor but the buttocks and thighs are above the toilet. This is
accomplished through knee extension and trunk flexion. (Greed, 2003)

#### Squatting
In squatting, the thighs touch the legs and the trunk touches or nearly touches
the thighs.  In order to accomplish this on a sitting-style toilet, one puts his
or her feet on the toilet seat. This is probably much less common in countries
where sitting toilets are the norm.

Confusingly, term "squatting" is also often used to refer to what I term "hovering".

#### Standing
Males commonly stand at toilets when they are urinating.
In this posture, the person faces the toilet and stands in front of the toilet.
