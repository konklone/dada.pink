title: Can we open our open data questionnaires?
description: I ponder whether GovLab and Sunlight Foundation are sharing data from their open data questionnaires.
twitter_description: Also, would knowledge that an open data questionnaire was going to be open data get you to fill it out?

On September 19, I got
[this email](http://us6.campaign-archive2.com/?u=1a990feb5c&id=46f97c829f&e=f59483af9a)
from the [GovLab](http://thegovlab.org/).
It requested that tell them about companies who are using open data
by filling out a questionnaire within two weeks (September 27).

On November 24, I saw a tweet about a
[strangely similar request](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/11/20/the-global-open-data-initiative-needs-your-input/),
with the questionnaire due November 29.

## Sharing data to save time
These questionnaires are quite similar; could we (GovLab, Sunlight,
and people filling out questionnaires) maybe save some work if GovLab
and Sunlight shared the questionnaire data?

The questionnaires are not identical, so the questionnaire of one of
these groups might not satisfy the needs of the other, but I think it
would at least help.

## Open our data about open data
It's quite possible that Sunlight has seen GovLab's data. I hope they
have, as that probably would have saved some time. But even if they did,
I find it hilarious that **I** haven't seen the results of at least the
GovLab questionnaire.

The first Sunlight Foundation's 32 open data guidelines is to
[set the default to open](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#open-by-default),
so you would think that raw results of at least the GovLab questionnaire
would have been published by now.

## Sharing data to get people to contribute data?
Each time I saw these questionnaires, I considered sending them to
people, but nine days didn't seem like enough time for it to be worth
me telling people about them. Well that's what I say to myself, but
I feel like it's really an excuse; there's another reason I don't
like filling out questionnaires.

That other reason is that I'm generally quite skeptical that anyone
is going to look closely at the questionnaire. Assembling the questionnaire
and sending it out is a lot of work already; are they actually going
to have any energy left once they get the results back?

I wonder: Would opening the results of questionnaires would get me
to fill out the questionnaires?
