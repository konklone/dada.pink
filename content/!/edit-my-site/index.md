Most of the articles on my site are quite a mess, and it would be nice if
that could change. Here's how you can help.

## GitHub way
At the bottom of each article is a "View Source" link.

![The "View Source" link]()

Click this link and arrive at the GitHub page for the source file for the
present page. It's usually written in [markdown]().

![The GitHub page for the present page]()

[Create an account]() if you haven't already, and
[log in]() if you haven't already.

And then make a fork of the repository in GitHub if you haven't already.
That is, click the "Fork" button to fork the `www.thomaslevine.com` project.

Once you've created an account, logged in and forked, go to the "View Source"
link again. The URL is something like this.

    https://...

Switch "tlevine" for your GitHub username, and go to that URL. Then click
"Edit" and edit the page.

Once you've made a bunch of edits, you can submit a "Pull request", and
I'll get around to it eventually.

But you're better off <a href="mailto:_@thomaslevine.com">emailing me</a>
because I hardly ever look at GitHub notifications.

## Git way
There are some problems with the GitHub approach above. In particular,
it involves using the proprietary GitHub web interface, you probably
need a mouse to do it, and you can't create your own git branch. Thus,
you may prefer using git directly.
