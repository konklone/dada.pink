title: On listening
---
I was pondering whether anyone had ever given me particularly insightful
unsolicited advice, and I didn't manage to come up with any such situations.
Aside from suggesting that I should solicit advice (because I could think of
useful advice that I'd solicited), this led me to ponder whether following
unsolicited advice should be any better than ignoring it.

## Who
For some categorizations of people, both solicited and unsolicited advice
come from the same sorts of people. If I ask someone for advice, be she a
teacher, enemy, stranger, parent, friend, she might respond; or if I don't,
she might say something anyway.

## Differences
People have told me that different from the people for whom their unsolicited
advice is mainly intended; I think the supposed difference is generally that I'm
"smart" or that I "think" about things. Hmm. Perhaps there are relevant
systematic differences between the sort of person who would give advice without
solicitation and the sort of person who would listen to it. 

Talk here about how maybe you listen less if you talk more and that maybe the
thresholds for taking things seriously differ
