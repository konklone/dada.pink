title: On listening
---
I was pondering whether anyone had ever given me particularly insightful
unsolicited advice, and I didn't manage to come up with any such situations.
Aside from suggesting that I should solicit advice (because I could think of
useful advice that I'd solicited), this led me to ponder whether following
unsolicited advice should be any better than ignoring it.

## Who
For some categorizations of people, both solicited and unsolicited advice
come from the same sorts of people. If I ask someone for advice, be she a
teacher, enemy, stranger, parent, friend, she might respond; or if I don't,
she might say something anyway.

## Differences
People have told me that different from the people for whom their unsolicited
advice is mainly intended; I think the supposed difference is generally that I'm
"smart" or that I "think" about things. Hmm. Perhaps there are relevant
systematic differences between the sort of person who would give advice without
solicitation and the sort of person who would listen to it. 

### How much people talk and listen
Consider a civilized conversation between two people, where one person listens
when the other talks. Let's measure amounts of talking or listening in time,
and lets figure that both sides convey some advice. Now, let's measure the time
spent giving advice. (Let's ignore how we would categorize something as advice.
Or maybe everything is advice.)

In some cases, we'll find that one person talks much more than the other. Now
let's consider multiple conversations between the same people. Let's say that
this pair is the sort where different conversations tend to have a similar
division of time spent advising/talking. (So maybe one person tends to
talk/advise for about two-thirds of each conversation, and the other for about
one-third.)

In this case, one person provides twice as much advice than he receives, and
the other provides half of what he receives. That's interesting.

Also, why are they talking different amounts? Maybe one wants to talk more than
the other does. Maybe one wants to listen more than the other. Both of these
might be specific to the context, of course; maybe this division happens
one feels more qualified or authorized to talk or to listen. The one who is
talking more might be a salesperson who is paid to talk or a respected, wise
elder, to whom the other is posing questions on the nature of life.

This situation shows how there could be relevant systematic differences between
the sort of person who would give advice and the sort who would listen to advice.

### Thresholds for taking things seriously
maybe you listen less if you talk more and that maybe the
thresholds for taking things seriously differ
