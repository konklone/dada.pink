title: Utlity of a Data Hub
---

ScraperWiki wants to make a 
'[data hub](http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2012/03/09/from-cms-to-dms-c-is-for-content-d-is-for-data/)'.
More concisely, you can think of it as a thing that remembers everything you
know about your data, standardizes things and does little annoying things so
you don't have to.

Loads of different tools can already accomplish most of these components, so
I suspect that they aren't helpful for tiny projects with one person because
one person who knows what he's doing will already have his own way of doing all
these things; the data hub would be another thing to learn and software layer
to manage. If the person doesn't know what he's doing, it might be helpful, but
I suspect that he'd easily develop his own personal 'data hub', partly in his
brain rather than through written code, and that using the hypothetical
ScraperWiki data hub won't help him that much.

The benefit comes in standardizing the ways that different people do things.
