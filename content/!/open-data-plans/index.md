title: Open data possibilities
---
I've brief suspended my open data studies to prepare
some things for [Zipfian Academy](http://zipfianacademy)'s
first twelve-week course, but I've been accumulating
lots of ideas of things you could do with data about
open data. I plan on doing a lot of them, but I
probably can't do all, so you should take one of these
ideas and do something awesome.

## What's in the portals?

215/41f:om: Open data file format by portal over time
215/248:om: Socrata v GitHub

215/424:om: Compare official datasets (data.json) and all of the datasets by portal

## Better search and linked data

Automatic joins
Automatic unions
215/eab:om: Open data: Data dictionaries


## Data quality

215/d66:om: Open data: Completeness of open data
215/e8a:om: Dataset scorecard
215/638:om: Dataset prerequisites
215/ddf:om: Open Data Policy Best Practices

## Indirect
There are lots of data portals, and not all
aspects of the various data portals software
are documented. Here are some things that will
help with further studies in the areas discussed
above.

215/b6a:om: Who federates whom on Socrata?
215/21a:om: Download data from other data portal software
215/7ad:om: Open data and MuckRock

## Studies with open data

215/bf1:om: Where is gentrification gonna happen next?
