title: Open data possibilities
---
I've brief suspended my open data studies to prepare
some things for [Zipfian Academy](http://zipfianacademy)'s
first twelve-week course, but I've been accumulating
lots of ideas of things you could do with data about
open data. I plan on doing a lot of them, but I
probably can't do all, so you should take one of these
ideas and do something awesome.

## Better search and linked data



## Enhancing/automating metadata



## Data quality
