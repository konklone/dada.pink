title: What I think people who want to learn programming
---
Some people want to learn programming for the sake of it
rather than for a particular project. This is quite reasonable
today. blah blah




People often approach this by learning "Python", "JavaScript",
"Ruby on Rails", &c. These are all really broad topics, and
something something. I think people should learn things that
are immediately useful to them. So I came up with this list.


It's more focused on people who write a lot.

* A good text editor (vim or emacs)
* 


massive gap between people who are just starting and people
who know the stuff


### What is a text editor?
Word processor

more formatting
