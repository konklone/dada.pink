I have nine pairs of these socks.

![A pair of feet wearing black toe socks]()

Each pair contains a left sock and a right sock; the left sock only fits on the
left foot.

Figuring out whether a sock is a left sock or a right sock takes some time. I
could figure this out right after doing a wash and tie them in pairs. But not
having to do that is one of the benefits of all having all the same socks.

I could also just sort them into a pile of left socks and a pile of right
socks. But I wouldn't trust the piles to stay intact, at least if I'm not at
home.

If I have a pile of mixed left socks and right socks, I can confidently select
enough to have as many as I need for a trip by taking extra socks. Some mental
arithmetic told me how many I need. I've drawn it on paper so it's easier to
explain.
