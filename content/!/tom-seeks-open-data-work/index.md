title: Tom seeks open data work.
description: I'm looking for work that will let me study open data all day.
tweet_text: Hi Twitter. Can I help you with your open data?

As you may have realized, I've recently been [studying](/open-data)
data about [open data](/!/what-is-open-data)
so that we can use data to drive our opening of
data. It has been more fun than many other things I've done, and I
want to keep doing this research all day. So now I'm looking for work
that will allow that.

## Things I can do for you
There are a lot of things about open data that I want to look at,
and they can be aligned with quite a many different efforts/organizations.

If you work for a software company, I can prototype or implement new
features in your product to make open data better. This could involve
new ways of [checking for out-of-date data](/!/data-updatedness/) and
new ways of [searching for data](/!/openprism/).

If you work for an organization that wants to release open data
or share data internally, I can quantify how well your efforts are going,
figure out what's working, and find ways of making things go better.
I've previously looked at
[whether datasets are appropriately licensed](/!/open-data-licensing/),
[how in-browser charting tools are used](/!/socrata-users/), and
[what sorts of data are available in a data catalog](/!/missouri-data-licensing/).

If you are giving grants in relation to open data, we should talk.
I have a [long list](https://github.com/tlevine/open-data-things) of things
that I want to do, and it's way more than I can possibly do;
I can prioritize them somewhat based on your interests.

## Interested?
If anything above sounded interesting to you or
if you think you have something interesting that I haven't thought of,
email me at [\_@thomaslevine.com](mailto:_@thomaslevine.com).
