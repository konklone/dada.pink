title: Hip "Data" Nonsense

I've been at loads of hip and non-hip data talks here and there and have come
up with some ideas about what this data nonsense is.

"Big data" and "data science"
---
Maybe there's a better term than "data nonsense". The two main ones I here that
relate to this beginning-of-a-field are "big data" and "data science". What do
these mean?

When people describe something as "big data", the thing is usually physically
big (in bytes). So a petabyte of data would might be big data.

Other people propose thresholds, like when the data don't fit in random-access
memory or when the data don't fit on one computer. (Some talk at Strata NY 2011
used this one.) More generally, we might say that data are "big" when they
don't physically fit the world's standard data analysis tool, [Excel](/!/excel/).

Judging data-bigness by physical size works today, but the size that seems big
today is different from what seemed big twenty years ago and from what will
seem big in twenty years.


In some
circles, one of these terms is more popular than the other
