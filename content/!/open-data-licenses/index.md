title: Open data licenses
---
Open data are "open", but do their licenses reflect that?
I downloaded all of the metadata files from 102 open data
portals hosted on CKAN, Socrata and OpenDataSoft. Each of
these data portal softwares has a metadata field for the
license of each particular dataset. I looked at whether
those were used and at what the licenses were.

I looked first at whether people used the metadata field at
all.

Surprisingly to me, all datasets in most portals have a
license field set.

I then made a rough mapping between the free-form names of the
licenses and some standard licenses. I didn't test this
very well, so there are probably some errors, but I think
these results are informative regardless. Here are the
standardized licenses for all of the data.
