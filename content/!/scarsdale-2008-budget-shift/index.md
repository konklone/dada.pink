The village substantially reduced expenditures after 2008, mainly in
the capital projects fund.

(I have a graph.)

The fund's appropriation typically increases by a couple million dollars each
year, but the appropriation was decreased by about $20 million in 2009-2010,
or about two-thirds.

## 2009 Changes
More specifically, public building costs were decreased by about $11.5 million,
and highway improvement costs were decreased by about $8.5 million.
(See page 109 of the [2009-2010 budget](2009-2010_adopted_budget.pdf))

The decrease in public building cost can be explained by reduced work on the
Public Safety HQ Renovation/Expansion, which had cost $12 million in 2008-2009.
(See page 117 of the [2009-2010 budget](2009-2010_adopted_budget.pdf))

The decrease in highway improvement cost can be explained by reduced bridge
construction, for which about $9 million had been allocated in 2009-2010.
(See page 119 of the [2009-2010 budget](2009-2010_adopted_budget.pdf))

## Previous appropriations
Each budget shows the information for a few years prior. Based on this, it
appears that the budgeted appropriations jumped to a higher level a few years
ago.


# Public Safety HQ expansion
In 2005-2006, the public safety HQ expansion ($5.5 million) was budgeted but
not undertaken. It was to be funded by a bond, so I guess they just didn't take
out the loan.

The same happened in 2006-2007. It happened yet again in 2007-2008, but the
cost estimate was $11 million instead of $5.5 million. It finally happened in
2009-2010. That year, the cost was originally predicted to be $12 million, but
it appears to have wound up costing only $11.5 million.
