As you may have realized, I've recently been [studying](/open-data)
data about [open data](/!/what-is-open-data)
so that we can use data to drive our opening of
data. Because data. Data, data, data!

I want to keep doing this research all day.

## Things I can do for you
**If you work for a data-related software company**, I can prototype or implement new
features in your product to make open data better. This could involve
things like [identification of out-of-date data](/!/data-updatedness/) and
[new ways of searching for data](/!/openprism/).

**If you work for an organization that wants to release open data**
or share data internally, I can quantify how well your efforts are going,
figure out what's working, and find ways of making things go better.
I've previously looked at
[whether datasets are appropriately licensed](/!/open-data-licensing/),
[what sorts of data are available in a data catalog](/!/missouri-data-licensing/), and
[how in-browser charting tools are used](/!/socrata-users/).

**If you are giving grants in relation to open data**, we should talk.
I have a [long list](https://github.com/tlevine/open-data-things) of things
that I want to do.

## Interested?
If anything above sounded interesting to you or
if you think you have something interesting that I haven't thought of,
