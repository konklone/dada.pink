Earmuffs
=====
Ear plugs get annoying, so I got a pair of ear muffs two and a half years ago on
Christmas. <!-- thread:00000000000116c9 -->
They're the [Glock Peltor Hearing Protector Muffs AP60212](http://www.opticsplanet.com/glock-peltor-hearing-protector-muffs.html).

They were pretty awesome. They're much more convenient than ear plugs, they don't
dampen quite as much noise as ear plugs, they look slick enough that I didn't feel
weird wearing them at parties, and they were cheap.

But here are some things I didn't like. My ears got sweaty and soft, and I wonder
whether that did something bad to them. They also pressed pretty hard against my
head. And, most problematically, they broke.

So now I'm going to get some new ones. I think I looked at some ear muff review
site when I got them, but I can't find that site, I started with OpticsPlanet, the
store from which I bought the AP60212.
