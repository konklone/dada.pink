Earmuffs
=====
Ear plugs get annoying, so I got a pair of ear muffs two and a half years ago on
Christmas. <!-- thread:00000000000116c9 -->
They're the [Glock Peltor Hearing Protector Muffs AP60212](http://www.opticsplanet.com/glock-peltor-hearing-protector-muffs.html).

They were pretty awesome. They're much more convenient than ear plugs, they don't
dampen quite as much noise as ear plugs, they look slick enough that I didn't feel
weird wearing them at parties, they were cheap, and they didn't use electricity.

But here are some things I didn't like. My ears got sweaty and soft, and I wonder
whether that did something bad to them. They also pressed pretty hard against my
head. And, most problematically, they broke.

So now I'm going to get some new ones. I think I looked at some ear muff review
site when I got them, but I can't find that site, I started with OpticsPlanet, the
store from which I bought the AP60212.

I looked at their [best-rated hearing protection](http://www.opticsplanet.com/hearing-protection-best-rated.html).
The most expensive highly rated passive earmuffs are the
[Pro-Ears Ultra Passive 33](http://www.opticsplanet.com/pro-ears-ultra-passive-33-shooting-hearing-protection-heads-pe-33-u-b-black.html).
Bizarrely, these are more expensive than the lower-rated
[28 NRR version](https://www.opticsplanet.com/pro-ears-ultra-passive-28-shooting-hearing-protection-heads-pe-28-u-b-black.html).
Also, this one comes in pink. :)

They have a plastic band connecting the sides, rather than a steel band like my
AP60212 had. This makes them more comfortable and less durable, at least according
to the reviews.

I decided to get an active hearing protector as well. The following models each
had at least ten reviews and cost at least $50.
