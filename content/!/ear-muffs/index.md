title: Earmuffs
---

Ear plugs get annoying, so I got a pair of ear muffs two and a half years ago on
Christmas. <!-- thread:00000000000116c9 -->
They're the [Glock Peltor Hearing Protector Muffs AP60212](http://www.opticsplanet.com/glock-peltor-hearing-protector-muffs.html).

They were pretty awesome. They're much more convenient than ear plugs, they don't
dampen quite as much noise as ear plugs, they look slick enough that I didn't feel
weird wearing them at parties, they were cheap, and they didn't use electricity.

But here are some things I didn't like. My ears got sweaty and soft, and I wonder
whether that did something bad to them. They also pressed pretty hard against my
head. And, most problematically, they broke.

So now I'm going to get some new ones. I think I looked at some ear muff review
site when I got them, but I can't find that site, I started with OpticsPlanet, the
store from which I bought the AP60212.

I looked at their [best-rated hearing protection](http://www.opticsplanet.com/hearing-protection-best-rated.html).
The most expensive highly rated passive earmuffs are the
[Pro-Ears Ultra Passive 33](http://www.opticsplanet.com/pro-ears-ultra-passive-33-shooting-hearing-protection-heads-pe-33-u-b-black.html).
Bizarrely, these are more expensive than the lower-rated
[28 NRR version](https://www.opticsplanet.com/pro-ears-ultra-passive-28-shooting-hearing-protection-heads-pe-28-u-b-black.html).
Also, this one comes in pink. :)

They have a plastic band connecting the sides, rather than a steel band like my
AP60212 had. This makes them more comfortable and less durable, at least according
to the reviews.

I decided to get an active hearing protector as well. The following models each
had at least ten reviews and cost at least $50. I put them here in ascending order
by price.

1. [Howard Leight Impact Sport Electronic Noise Amplification Earmuffs R-01526](http://www.opticsplanet.com/howard-leight-impact-sound-management-electronic-hearing-proctection-earmuffs-r01526.html)
2. [3M Peltor 6S Tactical Hearing Protection Ear Muffs](http://www.opticsplanet.com/peltor-tactical-hearing-protectors.html)
3. [Browning Midas Electronic Hearing Protector - Black 12627](http://www.opticsplanet.com/browning-midas-electronic-hearing-protector-black-12627.html)
4. [Pro-Ears Pro 300 Shooting Hearing Protection Headsets](http://www.opticsplanet.com/pro-ears-predator-plus-shooting-hearing-protection-headsets-p300p-black.html)
5. [Peltor TacticalPro Electronic Hearing Protector - Collapsable Folding Headband MT15H7F-SV](http://www.opticsplanet.com/peltor-protac-electronic-headset-collapsable-folding-headband-mt15h7f-sv.html)

The first is also noise "amplification". Maybe I don't want that.
Reviews for 2 and 3 suggest that they're good value. Reviews for the fourth
suggest that it's good but overpriced. The reviews for the last one suggest that
it's quite good in all possible aspects. And one of these aspects, which the other
reviews mentioned less, was comfort over an extended period of time.

Reading these reviews, I get the impression that the fancy active hearing protectors
detect loud noises and add more noise cancelling when things get particularly loud.
This is quite nice for things like shooting guns, but I started wondering whether it
would work for me. Here are the things I want them for

* Ambient noise in offices and whatnot
* Train, bus, car, &c. noise
* Loud music at parties

Active noise reduction is supposedly best at ambient noise, so the special part about
the fancy ones is how they handle sudden noises like gunshots.

Anyway, I think I'm going with these two pairs of ear muffs.
