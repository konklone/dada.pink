With our current tools, big data leads quickly to information overload.

I've recently been seeing a trend towards animated visual/audio data presentation
experiences. I started toying with this a few years ago around Christmas time.

They've recently become more popular. Some colleagues and I developed a
multisensory display of treasury data.

KÃ¼echenstudio made a [podcast](http://www.kuechenstud.io/datenschau/podcast/ds008/)
about some of the other recent advances in data music.

Leveraging animation and multiple senses reduces information overload,
but it also appeals to a younger audience. Here's a music video that the White
House released to advertise the State of the Union Address. It uses pie charts
and dubstep to appeal to a younger audience.

Data animations are also becoming popular in experimental physics, for both the
ATLAS and CMS experiments.

I see a clear trend towards multisensory data displays. I actually see this as
a major opportunity to disrupt the data visualization industry, replacing it
with multisensory experiences.

This is why I've [developed](http://symph.io) a technology for ambient,
realtime presentations of complex, high-dimensional data. This new
data-presentation paradigm will transform the way realtime big data is used
in business.
