Big data leads quickly to information overload.

How can we deal with this?

I've recently been seeing a trend towards animated visual/audio data presentation
experiences. I started toying with this a few years ago around Christmas time.

They've recently become more popular. My [band](http://csvsoundsystem.com)
made a music video of treasury data.

KÃ¼echenstudio made a [podcast](http://www.kuechenstud.io/datenschau/podcast/ds008/)
about some of the other recent advances in data music.

Combining data with music, specifically, may also appeal to a younger audience.
This is because both data is "in".

Recognizing this, the White House released to advertise the State of the
Union Address. It uses pie charts and dubstep to appeal to a younger audience.

Data animations are also becoming popular in experimental physics, for both the
ATLAS and CMS experiments.

Dynamic, multisensory data experiences will help us make sense of big data.
In the long term, we really need to gastronomify data in order to experience
them with all of the senses, but that isn't feasible right now because of the
reasonably high cost of food printers (three-dimensional printers).

Until we develop cheaper taste and smell APIs, we are stuck with what we have
on our smartphones, laptops, &c., which is vision, hearing and touch. We need
to make data music videos in order to make the most of these tools.
