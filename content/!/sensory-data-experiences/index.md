With our current tools, big data leads quickly to information overload.

I've recently been seeing a trend towards animated visual/audio data presentation
experiences. I started toying with this a few years ago around Christmas time.

They've recently become more popular. Some colleagues and I developed a
multisensory display of treasury data.

KÃ¼echenstudio made a [podcast](http://www.kuechenstud.io/datenschau/podcast/ds008/)
about some of the other recent advances in data music.

Leveraging animation and multiple senses reduces information overload,
but it also appeals to a younger audience. Here's a music video that the White

and dubstep to appeal to a younger audience.



Data animations are also becoming popular in experimental physics, for both the
ATLAS and CMS experiments.
