Big data leads quickly to information overload.

How can we deal with this?

I've recently been seeing a trend towards animated visual/audio data presentation
experiences. I started toying with this a few years ago around Christmas time.

They've recently become more popular. My [band](http://csvsoundsystem.com)
and I developed a music video of treasury data.

KÃ¼echenstudio made a [podcast](http://www.kuechenstud.io/datenschau/podcast/ds008/)
about some of the other recent advances in data music.

Combining data with music, specifically, may also appeal to a younger audience.
Here's a music video that the White House released to advertise the State of the
Union Address. It uses pie charts and dubstep to appeal to a younger audience.

Data animations are also becoming popular in experimental physics, for both the
ATLAS and CMS experiments.

Data music videos are the future.
