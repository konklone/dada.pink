I made a pie π! No, not a [pypy](),
nor a [π pie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pi_pie2.jpg),
and not even [π pies]().
I mean a letter π made of [pied type]()!

![A letter "π" made of jumbled up letters, printed in green ink on off-white paper]()

I printed this on letterpress on March 14, 2009.

(That was back when I used π; now I use [τ](http://tauday.com/).)
