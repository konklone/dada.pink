### `par()$box`

    ‘bty’ A character string which determined the type of ‘box’ which
         is drawn about plots.  If ‘bty’ is one of ‘"o"’ (the
         default), ‘"l"’, ‘"7"’, ‘"c"’, ‘"u"’, or ‘"]"’ the resulting
         box resembles the corresponding upper case letter.  A value
         of ‘"n"’ suppresses the box.
