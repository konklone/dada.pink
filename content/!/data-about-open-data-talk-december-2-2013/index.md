I'm just spoke at [this](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Open-Data/events/147380312/),
so I prepared some materials for it, based largely on the stuff [here](/open-data).

## Open data

## Brainstorming

I'll also talk a bit about brainstorming and six thinking hats.

## Exercises

### Outline a program
Choose an open data catalog from this list (link).

* http://data.dc.gov/
* http://www.civicapps.org/datasets
* http://data.raleighnc.gov
* http://www.utah.gov/open/
* http://nhopengov.org/
* http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/service/data

http://www.opendatadc.org/  n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a http://www.opendataphilly.org/  n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a http://hawaiiopendata.com/  n/a n/a n/a n/a http://data.openoakland.org/  n/a

First, diagram how a person could manually download all of the datasets.

After you've done that, change the labels in the diagram so that it describes
a computer program that downloads the datasets.

### Operationalizing constructs
Select a document from this list, then select a single guideline within
the document. Brainstorm ways that you could test how well the guideline
is being followed. Try to come up with approaches that don't involve
much manual work.
