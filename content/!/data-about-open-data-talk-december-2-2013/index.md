I'm just spoke at [this](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Open-Data/events/147380312/),
so I prepared some materials for it, based largely on the stuff [here](/open-data).

## Open data

## Brainstorming

I'll also talk a bit about brainstorming and six thinking hats.

## Exercises

1. Choose an open data catalog from this list (link). Diagram how a person could manually download all of the datasets. Then change the labels in the diagram so that it describes a computer program that downloads the datasets.
2. Select a guideline from one of these lists, and brainstorm ways of testing it.
