Here are some materials for
[my talk at NYC Open Data](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Open-Data/events/147380312/).

## Data about open data
Let's talk about some things I've been [learning about open data](/open-data).
For the longest time, I had no idea what people meant when they were talking
about "open data". But now I have [this video](/!/open-data-in-plain-english)
that gives a decent explanation, at least for government data.

To some degree, "open data" is just the sharing of data, but we have a word for
it because people aren't used to this idea. Sharing data within just company is
already pretty hard, but good things might happen once you do it.

One benefit of open data might be the ability for people to use lots of different
datasets in order to make data-driven decisions. The people who are releasing open
data surely get this, so they're obviously using data to make decisions about their
open data initiatives, right?

Actually, they're not, so I started doing that. Also, I'm doing it quite publicly,
so you could say this is open data about open data.

## Brainstorming

I'll also talk a bit about brainstorming and six thinking hats.

## Exercises

### Outline a program
Choose an open data catalog from this list.

* [Washington, District of Columbia](http://data.dc.gov)
* [Greater Portland, Oregon](http://www.civicapps.org/datasets)
* [Utah](http://www.utah.gov/open)
* [New Hampshire](http://nhopengov.org)
* [Louisville, Kentucky](http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/service/data)
* [Philidelphia, Pennsylvania](http://www.opendataphilly.org) (It runs [this software](https://github.com/azavea/Open-Data-Catalog/).)

First, diagram how a person could manually download all of the datasets.
You want to get the most raw form available, not the sort of aggregates
that you might see in a plot.

After you've done that, change the labels in the diagram so that it describes
a computer program that downloads the datasets.

### Operationalizing constructs
Select a document from this list, then select a single guideline within
the document. Brainstorm ways that you could test how well the guideline
is being followed. Try to come up with approaches that don't involve
much manual work.

* Open Knowledge Foundation [Open Data Census](http://census.okfn.org/)
* Tim Berners-Lee [Five Stars](http://inkdroid.org/journal/2010/06/04/the-5-stars-of-open-linked-data/) of open linked data.
