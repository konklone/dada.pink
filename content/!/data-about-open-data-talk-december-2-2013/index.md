I'm just spoke at [this](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Open-Data/events/147380312/),
so I prepared some materials for it, based largely on the stuff [here](/open-data).

## Open data

## Brainstorming

I'll also talk a bit about brainstorming and six thinking hats.

## Exercises

### Outline a program
Choose an open data catalog from this list.

* [Washington, District of Columbia](http://data.dc.gov)
* [Greater Portland, Oregon](http://www.civicapps.org/datasets)
* [Utah](http://www.utah.gov/open)
* [New Hampshire](http://nhopengov.org)
* [Louisville, Kentucky](http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/service/data)
* [Philidelphia, Pennsylvania](http://www.opendataphilly.org) (It runs [this software](https://github.com/azavea/Open-Data-Catalog/).)

First, diagram how a person could manually download all of the datasets.
You want to get the most raw form available, not the sort of aggregates
that you might see in a plot.

After you've done that, change the labels in the diagram so that it describes
a computer program that downloads the datasets.

### Operationalizing constructs
Select a document from this list, then select a single guideline within
the document. Brainstorm ways that you could test how well the guideline
is being followed. Try to come up with approaches that don't involve
much manual work.

* Open Knowledge Foundation [Open Data Census](http://census.okfn.org/)
* Tim Berners-Lee [Five Stars](http://inkdroid.org/journal/2010/06/04/the-5-stars-of-open-linked-data/) of open linked data.
