I've recently been noticing that nobody really knows what open data
are out there. There are all of these different datasets with various
schemas on all of these portals, but people don't wind up hearing
about many of them.

### Naive search method
Part of the issue is that portals approach searching data as if they
were normal files; your search terms are some keywords, a category, &c.,
and your results are dataset titles and descriptions.
[AppGen](http://www.appgen.me/) presents a different approach to search;
AppGen searches for datasets with the same variables as each other,
and the result was is randomly generated app.

### Siloed open data portals
Another issue is that people tend to use data from only one portal;
they use their local government's portals or their organizations' portals.

<!--
Maybe I want to find all of the tree inventories so I can expand my
[map of the urban harvest](http://fallingfruit.org/).
-->
Perhaps I'm considering making an app to help people find parking, and
I want to see what parking lot data are available before I put much work
into the app.
Or maybe I want to find all of the data about sewer overflows so that I
can expand my initiative to [reduce water pollution](http://dontflush.me).

In either case, I can find out what data exist by searching the portals;
I could copy my search terms into the search boxes on all different data
portals.

But that would take a while because there are a lot of portals.
In fact, there are so many that some people made a
[portal about data portals](http://datacatalogs.org).

[OpenPrism](http://openprism.thomaslevine.com) is one small attempt
to make it easier to search. You type your search in one search bar,
and you get results from a bunch of Socrata, CKAN and Junar portals.
