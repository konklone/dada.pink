As you may have realized, I've recently been [studying](/open-data)
data about open data so that we can use data to drive our opening of
data. This has been way more fun than real work, so I recently stopped
doing the real work. This gives me time to do some real work on this
stuff and also substantially reduces my income. I think you can see
where I'm going.

There are a lot of things about open data that I want to look at,
and they can be aligned with quite a many different efforts/organizations.
If you think I can help you, you should get in touch. I want to focus
on these open data things for now, but that is actually quite broad.

* If you work for a software company, you can hire me to prototype or
    implement new features in your product to make open data better.
* If you work for an organization that wants to release open data,
    you can hire me to quantify how well your efforts are going and
    to find ways of making them go better.
* If you are giving grants in relation to open data, we should talk.
* If you find my stuff useful but don't have any particular work you
    want me do (or if I'm already doing exactly what you want), you
    can sponsor my work.

As far as I can tell, "open data" is really just about multiple people
interacting with the same data. We call data "open" when anyone in the
world is allowed to interact with the data, but the same issues arise
when inside small teams in closed businesses. So you don't have to be
calling your activities "open data" to fall into this category.
