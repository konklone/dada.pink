English and American
====
While in England, I composed a list of translations between English and
American. I group them into three categories

  1. **Vocabulary** contains drop-in replacements.
  2. **Grammar** contains differences that affect to syntax, tense, &c.
    or that depend strongly on context.
  3. **Equivalents** are concepts that do not exist in both languages/places
    but are systematically similar.
