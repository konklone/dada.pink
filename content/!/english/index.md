English and American
====
While in England (mostly Liverpool), I composed a list of translations between
English and American. I group them into three categories

  1. **Vocabulary** contains drop-in replacements.
  2. **Grammar** contains differences that affect to syntax, tense, &c.
    or that depend strongly on context.
  3. **Equivalents** are concepts that do not exist in both languages/places
    but are systematically similar.
  4. **English-only** are phrases that exist in English for which I haven't
    found an American equivalent with a matching connotation.

Words in **parentheses** are optional; I include them for context or because the
phrase can be used with or without particular words

If a few different phrases from one country seem about right and I can't decide
which to use, (This is normally for American phrases.) I separate the different
phrases with commas.

If parts of speech are not obvious, the word is preceded by the abbreviated part
of speech and a colon

## Grammar

## Equivalents
I use different syntax in this section because I need to explain more about the words.

Where you go for a proverbial drink: In England, you go to a **pub**, and in
America, you go to a **bar**. But they're different things, and both exist in both
countries. In particular, you would only go to a bar for a drink, but you might
go to a pub for only food.

The hypothetical disgusting fast food establishment that you would never go to
is the **kebab shop** in England or the **McDonalds** in America.

The canonical cheap food in America is pizza. In England, it might be a
**kebab** or anything from a **chippy**, which often much different from a
kebab shop.

## English-only
You should see this table as definitions of English phrases rather than
translations; the connotation in the American column doesn't match the one
in the English column.

    English                     American
    -------------------------   -------------------------
    other half                  significant other
    brilliant                   great! wonderful!
    fortnight                   two weeks

## Other differences
Here are some general differences.

### Measurement
Different measurements units are used in each country. In England, metric is
normally seen as the standard, but in America, a subset of the imperial units
are seen as standard.

In both countries, certain imperial units are used specifically for specific
purposes. Some examples follow.

* **Bushel** in American (maybe English too) for measuring farm produce
* **Stone** in English for measuring body weight
