English and American
====
While in England (mostly Liverpool), I composed a list of translations between
English and American. I group them into three categories

  1. **Vocabulary** contains drop-in replacements.
  2. **Grammar** contains differences that affect to syntax, tense, &c.
    or that depend strongly on context.
  3. **Equivalents** are concepts that do not exist in both languages/places
    but are systematically similar.

Words in **parentheses** are optional; I include them for context or because the
phrase can be used with or without particular words

If a few different phrases from one country seem about right and I can't decide
which to use, (This is normally for American phrases.) I separate the different
phrases with commas.
