English and American
====
While in England (mostly Liverpool), I composed a list of translations between
English and American. I group them into three categories

  1. **Vocabulary** contains drop-in replacements.
  2. **Grammar** contains differences that affect to syntax, tense, &c.
    or that depend strongly on context.
  3. **Equivalents** are concepts that do not exist in both languages/places
    but are systematically similar.
  4. **English-only** are phrases that exist in English for which I haven't
    found an American equivalent with a matching connotation.

Words in **parentheses** are optional; I include them for context or because the
phrase can be used with or without particular words

If a few different phrases from one country seem about right and I can't decide
which to use, (This is normally for American phrases.) I separate the different
phrases with commas.

## Vocabulary

    English                     American

## Grammar

## Equivalents

## English-only
You should see this table as definitions of English phrases rather than
translations; the connotation in the American column doesn't match the one
in the English column.

    English                     American
    -------------------------   -------------------------
    other half                  significant other
