## Using technology to enable people
I see this attitude a lot.

> We are going to talk about how this complex fancy thing works so that we understand it better.

For example, we R-users are going to talk about how to run R with Hadoop.
Or, we JavaScript-users are going to talk about how to use Ember.

I also see the following attitude a lot, especially in San Francisco.

> We know how this complex fancy thing works, but a lot of other people don't, and it's hard to explain the thing.
> Let's make tools so other people can do the thing without needing to understand how it works.

For example, running R and Hadoop is hard, so we're going to make a phone
app that lets normal people do it. And making websites is hard, so we'll
make a web application that let's you make websites by pointing and clicking.

Both of those are great! This stuff is hard, so we're going to make it easy,
and then more people are going to be able to do it!

## Using technology to enable people?
I phrased those attitudes quite carefully; look at what happens when I bold some of the words.

> **We** are going to talk about how this complex fancy thing works so that **we** understand it better.

and

> **We** know how this complex fancy thing works, but a lot of other people don't, and it's hard to explain the thing.
> Let's make so **other people** can do the thing without needing to understand how it works.

In the first of these attitudes, we are special people

who are able to  these things,


and we need to simplify the things that we do so that normal people can do them too.
