Tom wants this stuff.
====================
Related: things Tom [doesn't want](have).

## A fast and portable laptop.
I'm starting to think that laptops are more portable than desktops.

* Lots of RAM
* Cool-running CPU
* SSD
* Quiet (preferably with no fans)
* Light
* Big battery

I plan on buying a broken one and replacement parts,
so if you have broken a nice laptop, I could possibly
use it.

## Mended pants
I have two nice pairs of pants with not-so-nice holes.

## The perfect day bag
I haven't figured out what this is yet.

## Public records
* Information about data catalog purchases, maintenance, and usage
* Anything about Scarsdale

## Bureaucratic
Maybe I should hire someone to do this stuff.

* Submit applications for grants, conferences, &c.
* Fill out forms
* Figure out bureaucratic processes
* Submit lots of freedom of information requests.

## Lodging
Now that most of what I care about fits in a
[suitcase](http://thomaslevine.com/!/stuff-2014-02),
I don't have a consistent apartment. I have an
approach to finding short-term sublets on Craigslist,
but it would be more fun if I didn't have to use it.

* Sleeping surfaces anywhere any time
* A roommate who is into my temporary sublet scheme
