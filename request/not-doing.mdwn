I'm looking for ways not to do things so that I can still sleep.

## Put calendar online

[/calendar](/calendar)

## Hire an assistant

[/administrivia](/administrivia)

## Email

I want to make lists of people to email. What should these lists be?

* Metropolitan areas
* Topics
* People who should receive periodic updates

Also, automatically add everyone to an aliases file.
