My application to the software technology track of the computer science
masters program was declined. The reason given in the decision email is below.

> The Selection Committee considers your academic background/specialisation not closely enough related to the MSc programme you wish to participate in.

I believe this to correspond with the following
[admissions requirement[(http://www.tudelft.nl/en/study/studying-at-the-tu-delft/admission-and-application/msc-with-international-degree/admission-requirements/).

> A good university Bachelor's degree in a main subject closely related to the MSc programme to which you are applying, with good grades on the key courses.

This leaves me somewhat confused.

## Entitlement of appeal
It is unclear to me whether I am entiled to appeal; the decision email says
the following.

> You are entitled to appeal to the Examination Appeals Board, unless you were rejected on the grounds that you do not meet TU Delft's formal admission requirements, as stated on our website (such as obtaining the minimum CGPA score and the minimum score on the English language test).

First, is closeness of academic background a formal admission requirement?
If not, I can appeal.

Second, what else do I do if the Selection Committee was in error regarding the
closeness of my academic background?

Some further documentation of the appeal process might clarify this.
I didn't manage to find that, but I did get this cryptic email in response
to a these two questions.

So I guess I'll appeal.

[Here](appeal-letter)'s the letter, and the directions follow.
