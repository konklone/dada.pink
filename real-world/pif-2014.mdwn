## Why would you like to be a Presidential Innovation Fellow?
I've lately been studying how governments publish open data
(http://thomaslevine.com/open-data), and I'd like to start
applying some of this research. The Presidential Innovation
Fellowship seems like one place to do it.

## Please copy and paste your resume below.

    ## Current engagements
    Vy Capital (http://vycapital.com) is a venture capital firm.
    I'm developing large-scale data-acquisition systems
    for them that collect data about the growth of companies.

    Enigma (http://enigma.io) collects a plethora of public
    data and develops a product with which people search the data.
    Enigma is sponsoring some of my spreadsheet research.
    In addition, I am advising them about issues
    relating to the scaling of their product.

    DataKind (http://datakind.org/) connects data scientists
    to high impact social organizations. I regularly do assorted
    data-related work and advising for them.

    ## Education
    Cornell University, Bachelor's of Science (May 2011)
    Design & Environmental Analysis
    Concentration in Human Factors & Ergonomics
    GPA 3.5
    Hunter R. Rawlings III Presidential Research Scholar

    ## Prior full-time employment
    I was on the development team at ScraperWiki (https://scraperwiki.com),
    where I helped design and build data processing systems and infrastructures.
    I also taught courses on the cleaning and analysis of data. (2012)

    I developed the curriculum for Zipfian Academy (http://zipfianacademy.com)
    and taught the first class of students. (2013)

    ## Prior consulting work
    I've done assorted consulting around open data and data engineering.
    Typically, I'll acquire data for a data analysis, or I'll add features
    to software for loading data from disparate sources.

## Data Innovation: Why are you great for this project?

    A year ago, I started downloading all of the datasets I could find
    on all of the open data catalogs that I knew about. And then I started
    running analyses across thousands of datasets at once. This has made
    me unusually knowledgeable about many aspects of the publication of
    open data.

    I understand the ways that people are publishing data, the sorts of
    data that people are publishing, the differences in how different
    governments do open data, and the differences between the various
    open data software tools.

    My research has arrived at some very practical results
    (http://thomaslevine.com/!/data-data-themes/)
    that I would like to implement in a place where they'll be useful.

    Specifically,

    1. I want to make it easier to search for datasets, without depending
        on having good metadat.
    2. I want to quantify how good a dataset is, and in what ways a dataset
        is good or bad, so that we can measure our performance in open data
        initiatives and make sure that are open data catalogs are in good shape.
    3. I want to use data-driven methods to measure the impact of the release
        of open data. I want to study the usage of government open data sites
        in order to see what how the way that data are published effects the
        way that people use them.
