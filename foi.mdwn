Here are some Freedom of Information requests that [Enigma](http://enigma.io),
or anyone really, can help me with.

## Open data
I want contracts pertaining to the open data initiatives of different cities.
A place to start is searching for contracts and RFPs about the "open data"
initiative or related to any of the following organizations or products.

* Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF, OKFN)
  * Common knowledge archive network (CKAN)
* Socrata
  * Open Data Portal
  * Data Collect
  * GovStat
* Junar
* OpenDataSoft
* Accela
  * Open Data Platform

Other ideas nice stuff would be contact information for public records officers,

I'd love to get this from cities randomly sampled from the population of all
US cities, but we could also just start with cities with data catalogs or
cities in Sunlight's spreadsheet.

## Scarsdale
I'm quite interested in anything about Scarsdale.

I've recieved a course list of
[notices of defect](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/scarsdale-283/notices-of-defect-between-june-1-2010-and-dec-9-2013-9483/),
and I would like the more raw memos or whatever containing the language of the original requests.

## Travel
I want to know how late all Amtrak trains were on all routes. I want to predict how late
a particular trip will be.
