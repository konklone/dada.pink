## Creating a remote git repository
Create a public remote git repository like so.

    mkdir new-project
    cd new-project
    git init
    publicgit

That creates remotes at
[git.thomaslevine.com](http://git.thomaslevine.com)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/tlevine) and sets them
as origin.

Create a private remote git repository like so.

    mkdir new-project
    cd new-project
    git init
    privategit

That creates a remote at [safe](/operations/) and sets
it as the origin.

(These functions are provided in the
[profile](https://github.com/tlevine/profile).)

No automatic repository creation is provided for
[sensitive](/sensitive/) or [Branchable](https://branchable.com).
