At the moment, I maintain two mailing lists for announcing things.

## The two lists
If you sign up for the *low-volume* list, you will get an email
every few months summarizing what I've been doing in general life.

If you sign up to the *high-volume* list, you will get frequent
messages about upcoming social gatherings, my geographic location,
my recent articles, solicitations for surfaces to sleep on, &c.

## Signing up
You can sign up for either list by writing your name on a webpage
or by asking me in an email. The former is easier for me, but it
reveals to the world that you are on the list.

### First method (preferred)
Here's the write-your-name-on-a-webpage method. Go to one of these
pages.

* [low-volume](low-volume)
* [high-volume](high-volume)

Once you're there, click "edit", then type your first name, a dot,
and then your last name. For example, if I were adding myself to
my own list, I would write `thomas.levine`. I also need to have you
in my (other) mutt aliases file, so send me an email too.

### Second method (private)
If you don't want your name to be on the public internet, send me
an email saying that you want to be added to the list privately.

## Other lists
Do you think I should have a new list? Edit this wiki page and add it!
