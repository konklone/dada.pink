## Hiring
I want to hire someone to do bureaucratic things for me.
What legal things do I need to do about this?

## Business travel
The specific travel I've been doing has all been motivated by business,
so I'm wondering how much of it I can count as business expenses.
Moreover, what would I have to do in order to count most of my
lodging and travel as business expenses?
