As someone who feels wrist, back, neck, shoulder, &c.
pain when he works at a computer,
I want Tom's ergonomic recommentations
so that I know how to reduce this pain.

Some possible posts

* General definition of ergonomics, like my definition of data science
* Change is probably good: static loading, hard labor, sedentary work
* Adjustment of the chair is probably more important than anything else:
    anthropometry, chair features, chair sexiness
* Everything is connected: Table-chair, eye-screen relationship,
    back pain manifest in the wrist
* Non-furniture things: Relax when you can
