Advice from Oren

* Gene sequences specify the construction
    of three-dimensional structures.
* Alpha helixes and beta barrels are two
    three-dimensional structures that are
    produced by repetitive gene sequences
* You can filter the sequences based on
    attributes like hydrofilic if the
    original sequence isn't desireable for
    music.
* Insulin and hemoglobin both have alpha
    helixes and beta barrels.
