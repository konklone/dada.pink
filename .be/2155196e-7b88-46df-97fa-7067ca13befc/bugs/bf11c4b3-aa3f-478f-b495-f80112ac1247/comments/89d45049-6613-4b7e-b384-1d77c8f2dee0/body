In conversation with Jay and Rodrigo at that bar after
that thing at City Hall some Friday, we/I hypothesized
that the places that will gentrify soon (that is, the
hip places) are the ones in which it is easy to set up
something new. That is,

* Cost of living is low.
* It's easy to move there.
* Legislation is less restrictive, or it isn't
    enforced.

Maybe I should move my quinoa index studies towards
this direction.
