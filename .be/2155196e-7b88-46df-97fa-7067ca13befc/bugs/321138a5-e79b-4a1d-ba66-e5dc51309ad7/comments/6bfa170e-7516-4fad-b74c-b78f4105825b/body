#2155196e-7b88-46df-97fa-7067ca13befc# Storage
We have a stack of books. They're heavy.
We also have a bunch of workers.

#2155196e-7b88-46df-97fa-7067ca13befc# Map
Each worker picks up a book from the book pile.
She copies the page count of each book and the
number of books (1) onto a piece of paper and
puts it in the paper stack.

The paper stack is only allowed to get so big.

#2155196e-7b88-46df-97fa-7067ca13befc# Reduce
When the paper stack gets too big or when there
are no more books, workers take papers from the
paper stack, add up the page counts and numbers
of books, and put the papers back into the paper
stack.

We end when there is only one piece of paper left.
