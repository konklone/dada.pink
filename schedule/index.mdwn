My calendar is spread across a few pal files.

* [Activities with durations](activities)
* [Sleeping arrangements](sleeping)
* [Things to do any time](to-do)
* [Birthdays](birthdays)
* [Travel arrangements](travel)
* [Postponed](postponed) (These don't show up when I run `pal`.)

There's also a private file, as explained in the
[operations](/operations/) page.
