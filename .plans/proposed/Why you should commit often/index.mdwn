Some students at Zipfian Academy were talking,
sort of jokingly, about how they would change
something and then the tests would pass and
they didn't know what they did. Write about how
committing a lot can help with this.

Basic

* `git commit . -m 'minor change for which tom types gobbledygook'`
* `git log file.txt`
* `git checkout commithash`
* `git diff file.txt`

Fancy

* `git bisect`
