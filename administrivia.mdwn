Forms and emails
===== 
A bunch of things keep coming up that involve reading a few websites,
filling out some clumsy forms, and sending some emails. I think
someone could be helpful on things like this. Here are some examples.

* Apply for me to speak at a conference that I tell you about;
    copy something that I've written (http://thomaslevine.com/!/)
    and fill out the rest of the application.
* Order a birth certificate, and fill out the forms for a passport
    application.
* Go to the weird site that houses my friend's dissertation, click
    through all the links to find the dissertation, download it,
    and email it to me.
* Submit freedom of information requests.

I think this is my issue with forms and emails: I don't really
like using computers, but I'm so fast at them that it make sense
for me to use computers for lots of things.

Here are lists of this sort of task to do.

* [Freedom of information](foi)
* [Apply to things](/applications)
* [Other forms and emails](forms)
