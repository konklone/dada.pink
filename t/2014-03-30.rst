Hi Friend,

This Sunday, March 30, is the anniversity of my birthday,
so something fun is going to happen. If I thought it was going
to be warm out, I would go to Staten Island in the afternoon
to taste the two remaining pizza restaurants on my list.

But I don't think it's going to be warm out, so I'm going to
go somewhere more convenient. And I would love for you to join.

I have yet to figure out what I want to do, but I've made a
page on my wiki because I can.
