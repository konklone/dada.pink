Here are some things related to my working with [Enigma](http://enigma.io)

## Freefom of Information requests
Enigma can submit Freedom of Information requests for me.
Here are some I want.

### Open data
I want contracts pertaining to the open data initiatives of different cities.
A place to start is searching for contracts and RFPs about the "open data"
initiative or related to any of the following organizations or products.

* Open Knowledge Foundation (OKF, OKFN)
  * Common knowledge archive network (CKAN)
* Socrata
  * Open Data Portal
  * Data Collect
  * GovStat
* Junar
* OpenDataSoft
* Accela
  * Open Data Platform

Other ideas nice stuff would be contact information for public records officers,

I'd love to get a list of all cities, or at least all US cities, and then send
this request to all of them. Or at least a random sample. So that's another FOI request.

Until then, we could start with
[these data catalogs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ap0CEAgs-R_odFc0Qk1WNHdIUDE3bUNVd1U3WUlnblE&usp=sharing).

### Scarsdale
I'm quite interested in anything about Scarsdale.

I've recieved a course list of
[notices of defect](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/scarsdale-283/notices-of-defect-between-june-1-2010-and-dec-9-2013-9483/),
and I would like the more raw memos or whatever containing the language of the original requests.

### Travel
I want to know how late all Amtrak trains were on all routes. I want to predict how late
a particular trip will be.

## Things I might do

- Socrata / Data Portal Downloader (Hicham/Brian to give you Enigma's
current pain points on this)
- OpenCorporates Analysis -> coverage, update frequency, EIN number
availability.
- Linking some Enigma/Source corp reg data to Open corporates (how
difficult is the matching and why)
- Crawling through the open data portal universe for company identifiers ->
strategy developement.
- Data,json scope (to what extent is it implemented, how clean is the data
etc...)
- Find outlying data points and tweet them.

## Other interesting things
Here are some things about data.json.
