Hard copy documents
----------------------

What hard copy documents do I need to send in?

1)
^^^^^^^^

    A. A certified copy* of your original academic degree (or degrees) in the original language.

I emailed the international admissions for further clarification.

    Dear Student,

    Thank you for your email.

    When applying you may provide a photocopy of it.
    You need to bring the original ones, after getting admitted,
    when coming to Delft.

    Kind regards,

I have had my father `scan my diploma <diploma.pdf>`_. I will print it out and enclose it.

2)
^^^^^^^^

    A certified copy* of your transcript (or transcripts) in the original language.

I have requested a transcript (http://www.transcript.cornell.edu/#a4) and will include the original transcript.

3)
^^^^^^^^

    [N]ationals from the USA, U.K., Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada are exempt from the proof of English language proficiency requirement.

4)
^^^^^^^^

    A clear and relevant essay in English (1,000 – 1,500 words) addressing the following:

    Your motivation for taking the MSc programme of your choice.
    Why you are interested in TU Delft and what you expect to find here
    If there are optional specialisations in the MSc programme of your choice: which specialisation(s) interest you most, and why?
    Describe your hypothetical thesis project; what kind of a project would you prefer if you were free to make a choice? Also briefly explain what you would want to explore in your thesis project. Provide a maximum of three hypothetical thesis topics and elaborate on your particular interests in them.
    A brief summary (maximum 250 words) of the thesis work or the final assignment (to be) done for your Bachelor's programme, including information on the credits earned, grade, and full workload.

I did not write a Bachelor's thesis, and I asked Delft admissions about that.
They told me a bit more about what I should write in this section of the essay.

    Please explain in your essay your case about the thesis.
    Instead describe what your research on these [other] projects was about,
    how you conducted your research, why you have chosen these projects,
    and what were the conclutions out of these.

I then emailed to check whether I could use my recent open data research.
I asked whether the topic of this section must be a project associated with
a university, and this was the response.

    It should be projects that you have done during your final year of
    your Bachelor studies.

I'm thus using my research on
[the hovering cycle](http://thomaslevine.com/!/hovering-cycle).
Here are some aspects of that that I can work into the essay.

* I was paid for about 6 hours per week for both semesters of my senior
  year (https://colts.cornell.edu/rptHistory.cfm)
* The highest amount of credits that someone in my program can earn for an
  honors thesis is six, or three per semester.
  (http://www.human.cornell.edu/dea/academics/undergraduate/upload/DEA-Honors-Program-Timeline.pdf)
* I received a Human Ecology Alumni Association grant to pay participants.
* I got IRB approval.
* In addition to the main sample, there was
  * Test-retest reliability testing
  * Validity testing through in-person interviews
* I wrote several reports on the statistical properties of the results as
  I interpreted the results.
* Main result paper is at http://thomaslevine.com/!/hovering-cycle
* Phlush published a simpler version at
  http://www.phlush.org/2013/02/23/the-hovering-cycle/

`Here <./essay/>`_ is the essay.

5)
^^^^^^^^

    Two reference letters in English, French, German or Dutch:

    * one from a professor or an assistant professor from the faculty from which you graduated.
    * one from your employer, if you already have work experience.

    If you have not yet graduated or do not have work experience, you need to provide two letters from professors or assistant professors from the faculty at which you are studying.

I asked David Feathers and Francis Irving.
I've written some `specifications <reference-letter>`_ for Francis.

6)
^^^^^^^^

    An extensive résumé (curriculum vitae) written in English.
