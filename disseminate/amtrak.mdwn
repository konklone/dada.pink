Why do you want an #AmtrakResidency?
----
I love Amtrak, and I love writing, and I write better when I'm on Amtrak. And that's when I'm in coach; who knows what will come out if I take a sleeper car!

I'm presently nomadic (http://thomaslevine.com/!/stuff-2014-02/), and it's partly because it means I get to take Amtrak more! I've taken three longish trips on Amtrak in the past month, and I'm going to take another on Tuesday.

So I really want an #AmtrakResidency because I just love being on Amtrak. I love the vibe I get around people on Amtrak. Everyone is relaxed and
down-to-earth, and this atmosphere inspires me to pick up projects that
I've neglected.

How would this residency benefit your writing?
----
My writing surrounds the intersection between art and data.
In my art and writing, I try to get people thinking about new
ways of quantifying the world, and I use out-of-the-box means
of teaching people to think quantitatively.

Depending on when the residency falls, I will either
will either write an article that will people thinking
differently about computers, or I will write a music video
were the notes and visuals are programmatically generated
from numbers in a spreadsheet.

The former output would be a bit like these.
