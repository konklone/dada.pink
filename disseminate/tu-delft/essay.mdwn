## My motivation and interest in TU Delft
In my present research, I am obtaining hundreds of thousands of spreadsheets
and exploriing what possibilities emerge when I look at all of them.
I recently met Felienne H, who is a professor in the department (?).
She is the only other person I know of who is doing the same sort of research.
We had a wonderful conversation at a recent conference, and I would like to
continue my research under her.

## My hypothetical thesis project
My thesis project for the MSc would be an extension of my present research.
The basic premise of my research has been to explore what is possible when
we look at many spreadsheets at once, but I've been packaging my present
research into practical software tools that assist in the management and
sharing of disparate datasets. I describe below one 

come up with three practical ways of packaging my research

## Final assignment for my Bachelor's program
tens of thousands of spreadsheets at once
in order to develop software tools to unlock the value in disparate data....
Specifically: Seraching, data quality, metadata.
Also, the effect of data cataloging software on the usage of data.
