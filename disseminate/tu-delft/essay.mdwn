# I want to make it easier to work with lots of spreadsheets

## My motivation and interest in TU Delft
In my present research, I am obtaining hundreds of thousands of spreadsheets
and exploring what possibilities emerge when I look at all of them.
I am studying how people share spreadsheets, and I am developing tools
to assist in their sharing of spreadsheets.

I recently met Felienne Hermans, who is doing similar research as an assistant
professor in the software technology track of the computer science masters.
(This is the program to which I am applying).
She is the only other person I know of who is doing the same sort of research.
We had a wonderful conversation at a recent conference, and I would like to
continue my research under her.

Aside from the interest in spreadsheets and TU Delft specifically, I am interested in getting
some formal schooling in computer science. I have been programming for about
ten years and have been doing software engineering professionally for the past
two-and-a-half years, but I haven't really taken formal courses in computer science.

## My hypothetical thesis project
When we search for ordinary written documents, we send words into a search engine and get
pages of words back. What if we could search for spreadsheets by sending spreadsheets
into a search engine and getting spreadsheets back? For my thesis project,
I would like to prototype the "search engine for spreadsheets" that I describe below.

### How to use it
To use my hypothetical search engine for spreadsheets,
people would go to particular website and upload a spreadsheet. The uploaded
spreadsheet would be compared against one million spreadsheets that have previously
been found on the internet. After uploading a spreadsheet, a person would see
a page with links to relevant spreadsheets, previews of these spreadsheets,
and with brief notes as to why each spreadsheet was deemed relevant.

### Novelty
The search engine for spreadsheets that I propose is a very practical
and easy-to-use product that packages the complex, exploratory,
and theoretical research that I would like to do.

The novel part of this search engine project is the manner in which spreadsheets
will be compared; in addition to using
conventional search engine approaches, this website would look at the structure, schema,
and metadata of spreadsheets. It would identify relevant spreadsheets based on the
statistical properties of the uploaded spreadsheet. It would also allow for filtering
of search results based on these various properties.

Here are some sorts of unusual search/filtering strategies that the tool would include.

1. Find spreadsheets that can be easily combined with the uploaded spreadsheet.
2. Find spreadsheets with the same statistical unit as the uploaded spreadsheet.
3. Find spreadsheets that were produced by the same software.
4. Find updated versions of the uploaded spreadsheet.
5. Limit results to spreadsheets that are granular enough; for example, require
    that spreadsheets about unemployment have data about individual cities rather
    than just aggregated data about countries.
6. Limit results to well-maintained and up-to-date datasets.
7. Limit results to spreadsheets that are large enough for statistical analyses.

This project might seem overly grand, but I believe it to be quite doable because
I have already developed prototypes of the various components of the system.
Most of the work for this project would be the refining of these various
search/filtering strategies.

### Relationship to my prior research
My thesis project for the MSc would be an extension of my present research
on spreadsheets (http://thomaslevine.com/open-data).
The basic premise of my research has been to explore what is possible when
we look at many spreadsheets at once. I've been packaging my
research into practical software tools that assist in the management and
sharing of disparate datasets.

## Final assignment for my Bachelor's program
I assessed whether the cleanliness of a toilet affects the postures that people use.
The core of my study was a questionnaire to randomly selected university students.
The questionnaire asked about various bathroom practices about how these practices
changed when bathrooms were dirty.

Much was involved in running this questionnaire. Among other things,
I reviewed related literature on the topic;
I obtained approval from my institution's review board;
I applied for and received two grants to pay the participants in the study;
I ran two other rounds of the questionnaire (to test validity and reliability);
and I wrote a long-form report about my results, similar to a thesis.

While this was a project that I worked on for the full final year of my Bachelors,
this was not a Bachelor's thesis.

I worked on this as part of my
Hunter R Rawlings III Presidential Research Scholarship.
I was paid for about six hours per week of work (more on the busier weeks).
Also, I began work on this before my final year; I was working at a similar pace
for a few months during the prior year.

This is comparable to the workload expected for a Bachelor's thesis;
students writing Bachelor's theses earned at most three credits per semester
for the thesis.

I was advised by David Feathers, who is one of the two references that I have provided.
