I maintain a few email lists. I keep the first of these private,
but the rest are public because that's easier for me.

## Periodic reviews of life
If you would like to receive low-volume updates on my life,
tell me so [in an email](mailto:_@thomaslevine.com).
If you would like to remove yourself from this list or to
inquire as to whether you are on this list,
also send me an email.

This is the private list.

## Movements
I've been moving around quite frequently, and I would like
to be able to tell you when I'm in your town. If you would
like to be notified of my presence in a new area, you can
add yourself to [this list](movement).

To edit any of that lists, go to the page, click "edit", then
type your first name, a dot, and then your last name.
For example, if I were adding myself to my own list, I would
write `thomas.levine`. I also need to have you in my (other)
mutt aliases file, so send me an email too.

## Location-based
If you don't want to get *all* of the updates of my movement,
you can add yourself to a list for just your area.

* [New York City](new-york-city)
* [San Francisco Bay](san-francisco-bay)
* [Washington, DC](washington-dc)

Or create a new page for your area!
