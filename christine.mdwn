I'm lazy, so I have an assistant (probably Christine).
Here are some notes about that.

## Communication of things to do
I can send things to be done as some comination of emails and wiki pages.
In most of these things, I'd prefer the results of these tasks to be put
somewhere on the wiki. Exceptions to this would be things with private
information or things where the result is an email to someone else.

## Sorts of things that I want help on
I mostly want help [transcribing things](/misc/assistant-examples).
Also, all of the following is quite welcome.

* Skipping things that are wastes of time
* Rearranging the wiki so it's easier to find things
* Writing out things really sloppily so it's at least in the wiki
    rather than an email

## Financial arrangement
I pay a flat monthly rate. We'll need to do this paperwork.

* Christine needs to fill out a W-9 form.
* At the end of the year, I need to send Christine a 1099 form.

## Things to set up

* Create an email address for Christine, like christine@thomaslevine.com
* Set up automatic bill payments out of my bank account.

## Software
I'll try to set this up so that Christine doesn't need to use any new
software. We can set up the email address so she can use whatever mail
client she wants, and the wiki should be reasonably straightforward.

That said, I'm quite open to teaching Christine some of the Unixy
software that I use.
