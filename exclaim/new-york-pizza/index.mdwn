I hadn't eaten much New York pizza, so I asked
[Jared Lander](http://www.jaredlander.com) for some recommendations. He gave me
a list of 22 establishments grouped by expertly chosen categories. I needed to
know which one was closest to me at any given time, so I found the addresses
and plotted them on a map.
