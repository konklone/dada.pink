Thomas Levine is a dada artist who
whimsically moves
now that his apartment fits in a [small suitcase](/!/stuff-2014-02).
He likes to sleep, and he's usually curious about why people do things.
He has recently been playing [[!taglink music|sensing-data]], teaching data things,
and studying [[!how people share spreadsheets|open-data]].
His favorite color is [pink](/img/me-420.png).

## History
Playing with computers since he was young, Thomas eventually developed back and
wrist pain, and then he started studying ergonomics. His back and wrists now hurt less.
At some point, people started calling him a data scientist.

## Donations
I have this crazy dream where I can dada all day, afford to eat,
and still have time to sleep. Please consider donating to me if you find
my dada worthwhile.

[Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/thomaslevine) is an easy way to donate money to me.
Since I'm so mobile, I also accept donations of sleeping quarters;
[email me](mailto:_@thomaslevine.com) about that.
