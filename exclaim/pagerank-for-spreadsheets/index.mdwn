For the past few years, I've been hearing a lot about "open data".
I was apparently even an expert in open data even though I didn't
really know what it was. So I started going to various repositories
of open data, downloading all of the data, and looking at what they
contained.

(plot of dataset counts by site)

With hardly any effort, I had amassed tens of thousands of data files,
I quickly realized that nobody had any idea what was in these datasets,
so I started making tools to understand what was in them.

Before I talk about these tools, let me explain why nobody knows what's
in these datasets.

mostly in comma-separated values (CSV) format---spreadsheets without code



% We produce lots of spreadsheets. Cite some figures.
% When we have so many spreadsheets, how can we know what is in them?

% \subsection{Existing means of understanding a lot of spreadsheets}
% We could manually look at every cell in every spreadsheet,
% but this would take a long time. Instead, we develop tools,
% and standard practices to make this a bit easier.

% Many "open data" guidelines provide direction as to how a person
% or organization with lots of spreadsheets might allow other people
% to use them. At a basic level, many guidelines suggest that data
% be available on the internet and under a free license; at the other
% end of the spectrum, guidelines suggest that data be in standard
% formats accompanied with assorted metadata.

% Many groups have developed standard schemas for particular sorts
% of data. examples (cite stuff)

% \subsection{Things that don't exist but maybe should}
% The various tools that I describe above assist in understanding
% individual spreadsheets. What if we have a million spreadsheets?
% Even if we have the most perfect graphs about each separate spreadsheet,
% we won't have time to look at them all; we need to narrow down
% the spreadsheet base before we look at them

% It's like the concept of information retrieval and the-other-thing

% but I think we can take a qualitatively
% different approach to understanding
