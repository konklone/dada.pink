I have various mental lists of ways of asking more questions, but I only seem
to remember them when I need them. I'm trying to write them all down here.

When you want to think of something new about some thing, ask questions about
it that emphasize the words listed below. The quoted questions are responses
to the sentence "I like broccili".

* Five Ws
  * who ("Who else do you know who likes broccili?")
  * what ("What else do you like?")
  * when ("When did you start liking broccili?")
  * where ("Where do you like to eat broccili?")
  * why ("Why do you like broccili?")
  * how ("How do you prepare broccili?")
* Senses
  * sound ("What does broccili sound like?")
  * feel ("What does broccili feel like?")
  * smell ("What does broccili smell like?")
  * taste ("What does broccili taste like?")
  * look ("What does broccili look like?")
* Switch the roles of participants. ("Does broccili like you?")
* Vocabulary; examples:
  * "What is broccili?"
  * "What do you mean by 'like'?"
* Motivation ("Why do you mention that you like broccili?")

I should add something to this page about [Six Thinking Hats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats).
