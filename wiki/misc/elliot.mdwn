Hi,

As I explained a few days ago, the apartment that seemed pretty nice
before is now seeming less nice, so I'm getting out of it. The person
I sublet from wants me to help him find someone else to sublet it,
and if we don't manage to find someone within a couple weeks, I'll
let you just stay for free. (I'm happy as long as it's being useful.)

If I don't find someone within the next couple weeks, you're welcome to
have the apartment to yourself for as long as I'm paying for it,
starting probably in the last week of April.

Tell me if you know you won't want this or if there are specific dates
that are relevant (like if you need to be out of your current place on
a particular day). Also, I'll show you the place whenever we hang out.

Tom
