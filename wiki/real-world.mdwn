Here's my attitude towards responses to open calls for applications, papers, &c.
Only a handful of people will ever read what I submit, and I'll never have much
of an idea as to whether they read it or what they thought of it. This whole process
is very noisy, and I don't like that. Thus, I limit myself to a few hours per response,
I try to include buzzwords appropriate to the solicitation, and I don't ask for
other people to review the submission.

And I don't like to talk about these writings because it makes things sound overly
fancy and complicated. Given that attitude, I keep considering whether I should maybe
stop writing these.
