Tom wants this stuff.
====================
Related: things Tom [doesn't want](have).

## A fast and portable laptop.
I'm starting to think that laptops are more portable than desktops.

* Lots of RAM
* Cool-running CPU
* SSD
* Quiet (preferably with no fans)
* Light
* Big battery

I plan on buying a broken one and replacement parts,
so if you have broken a nice laptop, I could possibly
use it.

## Mended pants
I have three nice pairs of pants with not-so-nice holes.

## The perfect day bag
I haven't figured out what this is yet.
