Tom has this stuff and doesn't want it..

Related: things Tom [doesn't have](want).

## Desktop computers
I have two bespoke, artisinal, quiet, hand-crafted-with-love
desktop computers.

One is in an Antec P180 Mini case. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM,
a decent CPU, and quiet fans. I don't think it has any disk drives.
It has lots of room or disk drives and PCI cards.

One has an Akasa Euler case. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM an SSD,
a decent CPU, and no room for disk drives. It presently has no
wireless network ability, but I have a wireless network card that
might work with it. It has no moving parts, so it's pretty quiet.

[These people](https://twitter.com/thomaslevine/status/439103995894697984)
seem interested in it.

## Networking
I have multiple routers and wireless network cards.

## Books
I have lots of books, mainly on statistics, ergonomics, and typography.
