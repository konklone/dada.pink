Let's share our salaries! But how do we do that?
I think it's easiest if we each write a long discourse about
all of the ways we've earned money in the past few years
and how much we worked or what we did.

People often focus on the amount of money, maybe because it's
easier to count than the other things, and I think it's important
to talk about the other parts; my hunch is that it feels strange
when people have particularly high or low salaries and that the
amount of work that people do gets adjusted in order that the
salaries can stay normal.

Anyway, start a new section with your name and write about you.

## Tom
I worked at [ScraperWiki](https://scraperwiki.com) for 11 months in 2012
and made $45,833. I was working pretty much full time, but I was
a contractor. Also, the company is in England, and full time there
is a bit less work than full time in the United States.

I also did a small project for the
[Microfinance Information Exchange](http://www.themix.org/), over weekends
spanning three (?) months and made about $9,000.

I did lots and lots of work on [treasury.io](http://treasury.io) with
others from csv soundsystem and made $1,000 in 2013. And we won like $100
each as a prize from the [Bicoastal Datafest](http://www.bdatafest.computationalreporting.com/).

I worked for about a month full time at [DataPad](http://datapad.io)
in 2013 and made about $9,000.

I worked for about four months in 2013 at [Zipfian Acadamey](http://www.zipfianacademy.com/).
I worked a bit more than half-time, though it was a bit complicated. They didn't pay
everything they said they would, but it was nominally about $40/hour, and I wound
getting something like $12,000.

I worked for five weeks, about half-time at [Vy Capital](http://vycapital.com/)
during 2014 and made about $7,000 per week, or $35,000.

For the past month or so (in 2014), I have been working half-time for [Ontodia](http://ontodia.com/),
for $4,000/month. Note well: The project I'm working on involves looking at lots of spreadsheets,
and I was [already](/open-data) doing that for free, so most of it doesn't feel like work.
