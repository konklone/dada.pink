## Places
I'm going to

## Notes for people I'm staying with
Thanks for letting me stay with you! Here are some
things you might want to read.

### Things to sleep on
I'm quite flexible as to where I sleep. For example,
here are some suitable places.

* In my own bed
* On the floor
* In a shared bed
* On the banister of a staircase

I'll need a blanket or radiator. I can do without a pillow.

### Things I don't really need
I'm bringing these things with me, so I don't really need them.

* Towel
* Soap

### Laundry
I'll be fine with my own laundry supplies, but the following
always makes things a bit easier.

* Laundry detergent
    (I'm carrying detergent for only about sixteen days of laundry.)
* Drying rack, fan, &c.
* A large tub/bowl

I'm bringing [three pairs of shirts](/dada/stuff),
so I'm going to do laundry (usually in a sink or bucket)
at least every three days.

### CSV Files
I want to give you a [CSV file](/dada/print-formaldehide).
Remind me if I forget.
