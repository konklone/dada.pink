## Notes for people I'm staying with
Thanks for letting me stay with you! Here are some
things you might want to read.

I'm quite flexible as to where I sleep. For example,
here are some suitable places.

* In my own bed
* On the floor
* In a shared bed
* On the banister of a staircase

I'll need a blanket or radiator. I can do without a pillow.

I'm bringing these things with me, so I don't really need them.

* Towel
* Soap

I'll be fine with my own laundry supplies, but the following
always makes things a bit easier.

* Laundry detergent
    (I'm carrying detergent for only about sixteen days of laundry.)
* Drying rack, fan, &c.
* A large tub/bowl

I'm bringing `three pairs of shirts </dada/stuff/>`_,
so I'm going to do laundry (usually in a sink or bucket)
at least every three days.

## Things
I want to give away `CSV files </dada/print-formaldehide>`_.
Remind me if I forget.

I'm bringing an empty frontpack in case I ever acquire more
things than fit in my backpack. I have a feeling that I won't
wind up using it at all, so I'll probably want to give it
away to someone.

There are a few items that I wouldn't mind going shopping for.

* Custom ear plugs
* A haircut, and coloring of some of my hair pink
* A belt that doesn't dig into my skin
* A phone with service in Europe

If I wind up getting ear plugs, I'm going to want to give my
`earmuffs </dada/earmuffs/>`_.
