Notes for people I'm staying with
=====================================
Thanks for letting me stay with you! Here are some
things you might want to read.

I'm quite flexible as to where I sleep. For example,
here are some suitable places.

* In my own bed
* On the floor
* In a shared bed
* On the banister of a staircase

I'll need a blanket or radiator. I'm bringing soap and towel
and pillow, so I don't really need them. But they also can't hurt!

I'll be fine with my own laundry supplies, but the following
always makes things a bit easier.

* Laundry detergent (I'm carrying detergent for only about sixteen days of laundry.)
* Drying rack, fan, &c.
* A large tub/bowl

I'm bringing `three pairs of shirts </dada/stuff/>`_,
so I'm going to do laundry (usually in a sink or bucket)
at least every three days.

Things
========
I want to give away `CSV files </dada/print-formaldehide>`_.
Remind me if I forget.

I'm bringing an empty `frontpack </dada/stuff/>`_ in case
I ever want to carry more things than fit in my backpack.
I have a feeling that I won't wind up using it at all,
so I'll probably want to give it away to someone.

There are a few items that I wouldn't mind going shopping for.

* Custom ear plugs
* A haircut, and coloring of some of my hair pink
* A belt that doesn't dig into my skin
* A phone with service in Europe

If I wind up getting ear plugs, I'm going to want to give my
`earmuffs </dada/earmuffs/>`_.

Storage of important information
===================================
My passport is in my backpack. I'll take a picture and put it
somewhere on this site and link to it. I don't need a visa for
any of the countries I'm going to.

A summary of tickets for transportation things is in the
`travel section of my schedule </schedule/travel/>`_.
They are also in the "Notes" section of my email.

Addresses of places I'm staying are in the notes section of
my email. When I think people are okay with me putting it somewhere
public, these addresses will probably also wind up on this webpage
or in the aforemention travel schedule.
