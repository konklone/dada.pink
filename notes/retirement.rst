I want to retire. What do I need to do in order for that to happen?

## Long estimate
My yearly expenses seem to be approximately as follows. (Check it.)

    Thing,Yearly expense
    Places to sleep,"$13,000"
    "Planes, trains, buses, &c.","$3,000"
    Computers,"$2,000"
    Everything else,"$5,000"

Let's round the total to $25,000.

Also, my yearly income on the
order of $64,000 to $128,000. Figuring that a third of that goes to
taxes, I save something on the order of $25,000 to $50,000 per year.
Thus, for every year that I work, I can retire for one or two years.

Let's assume optimistically that I'm going to live until 94 (70 years),
I have about $200,000 in savings, and that's about eight years of
expenses. Let's round this to ten years and figure that I only have
to take care of 60 years. At my present rate, it'll take 20 or 30
years to save up that much money, and I don't feel like waiting that
long.

Note well: I'm ignoring inflation and instead doing all these calculations
in same-time currency. Also, interest will help a tiny bit, but I'm
ignoring it too to make the calculations easier.

## Removing housing expenses
If I remove housing expenses, my expenses go down to about $10,000,
so one year of work yields five to ten years of retirement. Also,
my present expenses would be worth 20 years. Thus, I would need to
work an 

## Kids and stuff
I haven't looked at all into what it costs to raise a child, but I
figure that it's on the order of what it costs to raise an adult.
Let's figure that I get married and hawe two kids. If the hypothetical
partner and I contribute equal funds, I'll have to pay for two people
(me and a kid) instead of just one. Let's figure that I need an
additional $300,000 (30 years at $10,000 each) to do this. That would
mean that I would need to work for an extra three to six years.

## Making money slowly
I'll feel more comfortable retiring with lots of savings, but it
kind of makes more sense for tax reasons to make money slowly. If
I make something more like $30,000 per year, my taxes will be a lot
lower.
