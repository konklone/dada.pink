Tom's thoughts: I rarely (never?) like using jargon, but I feel a lot
of pressure to use it. Maybe there's some cultural thing among the sort
of people who would write documentation? I think people assign jargon
labels to things when they don't understand it and want to fit it into
an existing mental model or to pretend (to themselves) that they
understand it.

BB: Newbie programming and documentation

DD: Pittsburgh community thing time-specific jargon that loses meaning
after some time
