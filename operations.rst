## Concepts
There are four levels of security based on where data may be stored. Data storage that is appropriate for one of these groups is appropriate for all of the subsequent groups,and *not* vice-versa.

Physical
    These data are to be stored only on computers that I can touch.

Locked
    These data are to be stored only on servers that are quite secure and are exposing few services to the network.

Numb
    These data are intended to be private but may be stored on servers that are running lots of servers and are quite open to the public.

Public
    These data are free for anyone to see.

Any piece of data will fall into exactly one of these groups. Also, all data should be in at least two places.
