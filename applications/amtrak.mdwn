Why do you want an #AmtrakResidency?
----
I love Amtrak, and I love writing, and I write better when I'm on Amtrak. And that's when I'm in coach; who knows what will come out if I take a sleeper car!

I love the vibe I get around people on Amtrak. People take planes when they care about getting somewhere soon, so everyone is relaxed and down-to-earth, and this atmosphere inspires me to pick up projects that I've neglected.

I'm presently nomadic (http://thomaslevine.com/!/stuff-2014-02/), and it's partly because it means I get to take Amtrak more! I've taken three longish trips on Amtrak in the past month, and I'm gonig to take another on Tuesday.

How would this residency benefit your writing?
----
While great things always come out of train trips for me, I can't entirely predict what that will be. I suspect, however, that this residency will prompt me to write up some thoughts on human motivation, some advice/tutorials for people learning about computers, and some stories about my recent travels. This sort of writing doesn't happen in my day-to-day life; I need a strange and relaxed setting to prompt it.

### Writing about motivation

I think a lot about how why people act the way they do. I talk about it reasonably often, and I keep meaning to write about it. Well I have written about it, but the ones that are published are too focused on computers, like this these.

### Writing educational things

The second thing I'll probably write is related to education about computers. It's a lot of work for me to explain how things work, so I try to write down my explanation every time I give one; this way, I can write about it later. This approach has led to several articles, such as these.

But I have at least three others that are mostly finished!

### Travels

I realized three months ago that everything in my apartment fit in two big bags (small enough that I could move on Amtrak!), and I've since gotten it down to one small bag. If I want to be somewhere for a day, I go for a week or a month. It's starting to get into a routine, so I'm about ready to write about the things that I've decided to put in the bag and the implications that this travel has on work and finances.
