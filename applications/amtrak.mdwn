Why do you want an #AmtrakResidency?
----
I love Amtrak, and I love writing, and I write better when I'm on Amtrak. And that's when I'm in coach; who knows what will come out if I take a sleeper car!

I'm presently nomadic (http://thomaslevine.com/!/stuff-2014-02/), and it's partly because it means I get to take Amtrak more! I've taken three longish trips on Amtrak in the past month, and I'm gonig to take another on Tuesday.

So I really want an #AmtrakResidency because I just love being on Amtrak. I love the vibe I get around people on Amtrak. People take planes when they care about getting somewhere soon, so everyone is relaxed and down-to-earth, and this atmosphere inspires me to pick up projects that I've neglected.

How would this residency benefit your writing?
----
This residency will prompt me to write up some thoughts on human motivation, some advice/tutorials for people learning about computers, and some stories about my recent travels. I have a bunch of writings-in-progress that range from rough notes to near-finished-and-just-needing-proofreading. I write software for work, so this sort of writing doesn't happen in my day-to-day life; I need a strange and relaxed setting to prompt it.

Here are some examples of the sorts of things that I might write about.
