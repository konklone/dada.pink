I recently visited [Kesselberg](http://kesselberg.info/).
A bunch of people live virtually without money on the scraps
of treasure that capitalism discards.

It feels like the weekend every day. That is, its relaxed
and calm and generally great, but it does have the same level
of annoyingness you'd find anywhere else. I love that people
are managing to live rather happily with pretty much no money.

## Not business
It was an amusing place to take a conference call for a
[World Bank](http://worldbank.org) project. The general vibe
I got at Kesselberg was one of intense relaxation and laziness.
If you're just trying to live and not worrying about career and
impressiveness and saving the world, life is pretty easy.

It felt wrong not to be completely relaxed and carefree there.
I was supposed to be working on two paid projects
(on my computer, remotely, for clients in the United States)
while I was there, but I found it hard to do very much work;
it felt very unnatural to look at screens or think about computers.

It might be that computers are inherintly a bit stressful.
Hardly anyone uses
computers or cell phones there, except for a couple of kids who
sometimes watch YouTube videos.

Having any business meeting
would have felt pretty wrong already, and World Bank's values
clash way too hilariously with Kesselberg's.
It was also pretty fun to imagine how colleagues
would react if I told them that I was in an illegally
inhabited place that is less "developed" in some sense.
(By the way, if you are one of those colleagues and are
reading this right now, I'm curious to hear from you.)
