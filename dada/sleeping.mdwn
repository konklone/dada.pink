I recently noticed that I *really* like sleeping, enough
that I think of it as a major motivation in life.
I seem a bit less interested in career-type things than
other people and often say that I want to retire.

I was in Oakland, California between May and November
of 2013. Like everyone has potluck dinners on Sunday
nights in the Bay Area, so I was of course at a friend's
potluck dinner. A few of us stayed overnight and found
ourselves sitting around the kitchen on a Monday. And
that was odd.

Someone asked, "**Are you all striking because BART isn't?**"
(Bay Area Rapit Transit workers had been considering a strike.)

One of us had just quit his job, another has never had a
real job, another had a real job that she didn't have to
go to a place for, and I was working part time.

**Yes**, we're on strike against boring work! Or we're retired,
because we're tired of work.
