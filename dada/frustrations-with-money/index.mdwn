I've been frustrated with the common use of money for several years.
I'm going to try articulating these frustations.

adjusting is expensive

### 
one dimension

abstract value, which can be exchanged for lots of things

## Better ways

Make it easier to adjust transactions, and record more dimensions!

Sharing our transaction history with each other might get us pretty far
with the first issue

Julian Todd suggests that we just hire a thousand lawyers for everyone.

Record more information about transactions! For important things,
we keep good accounts that tell us that a transaction occurred,
that a particular amount of money was moved, some information about
how it was moved, and maybe a description of what was exchanged for
the money.

Usually we just record
that we have a certain amount
