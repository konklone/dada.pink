How do I come up with ideas that seem new?

## Questions
I have various mental lists of ways of asking more questions, but I only seem
to remember them when I need them. I'm trying to write them all down here.

When you want to think of something new about some thing, ask questions about
it that emphasize the words listed below. The quoted questions are responses
to the sentence "I like broccili".

* Five Ws
  * who ("Who else do you know who likes broccili?")
  * what ("What else do you like?")
  * when ("When did you start liking broccili?")
  * where ("Where do you like to eat broccili?")
  * why ("Why do you like broccili?")
  * how ("How do you prepare broccili?")
* Senses
  * sound ("What does broccili sound like?")
  * feel ("What does broccili feel like?")
  * smell ("What does broccili smell like?")
  * taste ("What does broccili taste like?")
  * look ("What does broccili look like?")
* Switch the roles of participants. ("Does broccili like you?")
* Vocabulary; examples:
  * "What is broccili?"
  * "What do you mean by 'like'?"
* Motivation ("Why do you mention that you like broccili?")

## Why people do things
I generally wonder why anybody does anything, so I often ask about that.
This question often feels like brainstorming because nobody asks it.

If someone mentions that she has a particular hobby, I might ask why she
likes that thing.

If someone complains about how
[other](http://www.gop.com/) [people](http://www.democrats.org/)
are doing something stupid, I might ask why people would do such a thing,
or why people would believe such nonsense.

When people start companies, I always ask why.

When I saw a
[talk](http://2014.okfestival.org/okfestival-keynote-spotlight-patrick-alley/)
about how corrupt the world is and how
[Global Witness](http://globalwitness.org/)
exposes the corruption, I asked why people take part in corruption.

## Figure out what was appealing about prior good ideas

I should add something to this page about [Six Thinking Hats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats).
