Thomas Levine is a dada artist who
whimsically moves
now that his apartment fits in a [small suitcase](/dada/stuff-2014-02).
He likes to sleep, and he's usually curious about why people do anything.
He has recently been playing [[!taglink music|sensing-data]], teaching data things,
and studying the [[!taglink sharing|open-data]] of spreadsheets.
His favorite color is [pink](/img/me-420.png).

## History
Playing with computers since he was young, Thomas eventually developed back and
wrist pain, and then he started studying ergonomics. His back and wrists now hurt less.
At some point, people started calling him a data scientist.
