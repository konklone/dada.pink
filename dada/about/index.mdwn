Thomas Levine likes to sleep, and he's usually curious about why people do anything.
He has recently been playing [music](/sensing-data), teaching data things,
and doing [silly things](/open-data) with lots of spreadsheets.
His favorite color is [pink](/img/me-420.png).

## History
Playing with computers since he was young, Thomas eventually developed back and
wrist pain, and then he started studying ergonomics. His back and wrists now hurt less.
At some point, people started calling him a data scientist.

## Teaching
Thomas apparently knows a lot about computer stuff, and he wants to
[teach you](/dada/learning-data-stuff/) whatever he can.
