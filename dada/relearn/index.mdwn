## Bits and Sound

### File formats
We can think of sound as series of air pressures; a wave (WAV) file
is sort of like a series of numerirc air pressure values.

We can think of image as a grid of lights; a netbpm (PPM, for example)
file is pretty much just a cartesian grid of colored pixels, where
each pixel's color is specified as a triplet of red, green, and blue values.

In an eight-bit wave file, each byte is the air pressure value for
a frame of audio. In a binary PPM file, each byte is the intensity
value for a particular color (red, green or blue) within a particular
pixel of the image.

### Color versus oscillation
I ran [this](http://small.dada.pink/netwaves/drums.py) to
produce a [file](http://small.dada.pink/netwaves/drums.ppm)
that looks like this (as ppm)

and sounds like this (as malformed wave).
