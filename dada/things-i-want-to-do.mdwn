## Software things for other people

* Music for Roman's company
* Wetlands information system for Scott and the Gulf Restoration Network

## Letterpress and computers

* California case keyboard
* More [letterpress-printed data](/dada/print-formaldehyde)
* USB stenotype

## Ergonomicsy studies

* Something with Remedy Interactive's data
* [Wrist cracking](https://github.com/tlevine/wrist-cracking)
* Eye-screen distance as the primary concern in body posturing,
    perhaps using a camera to measure eye distance and REBA for
    the rest of the body posture
  * [My answer to a related question](http://www.quora.com/Ergonomics/What-should-be-the-distance-between-computers-and-human-eye/answer/Thomas-Levine-2?__snids__=114332382&__nsrc__=1&__filter__=all)
  * I previously started on a larger-than-I-want-to-do study
      on this and other things, and
      [this](https://gitorious.org/tlevine/casual_computing/source/42a9fe2ed6a2e54667172ef119e9a5d39f04ee24:literature_msd.tex)
      is as far as I got.

## Software things that nobody cares about

* Parser for grammars that describe grids, so we can parse spreadsheets
    more formally
* A way to search spreadsheets that considers their tabular structure
