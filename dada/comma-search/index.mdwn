You may have noticed that I've been much less active for the past few months.
This is partly because I've been acquiring some new datasets and setting up some
new infrastructure, and that involves some up-front work. Also, I've been
thinking a bit about how I might find spreadsheets that are related to each
other, and I'm going to tell you about that below.

## Open data is good for business?
But before I get to the main part of this article, I'm going to rant about the
other thing that has kept me busy.

I've been doing these silly open data studies for a while for fun,
and people have been saying that they're informative and useful and
important and whatnot, but people don't want to (or can't) pay me for
the open data stuff. So I gave up at finding funding for my silly
open data studies and over the past few months am doing some totally
unrelated work for money instead. I've also very recently received a
small bit of funding from some people to do silly open data stuff.
That's very nice, but it's small.

I understand that life isn't all about money, but sometimes it seems like
open data **is** all about money; that's pretty much

about why you need open data.
Since open data is supposed to be good for business,
it annoys me that people don't want to pay for it.

Could it be that open data isn't good for business?
Or maybe it is good for business but only because it is
externalizing business costs to volunteers.

Here's what I think.
Open data [isn't all about money](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/04/22/beyond-business-the-impacts-of-open-data/),
and the [business value isn't particularly compelling](http://blog.okfn.org/2013/11/08/open-datas-business-value-isnt-that-important/).
But things are only true if you can make money from them,
so open data is only good if you can make money from it.
Thus, everyone keeps
saying that open data is going to save money, enable new businesses,
and create new jobs. They're also saying that it's also going to end
corruption, make people trust governments, and otherwise save the world.
Open data is probably going to do some good, but these sorts of assertions
are exaggerated.

All of this hype is really confusing for me, and listening to it is a lot of
work. I wish we could make less of a big deal out of the little open data
toys that we're all making. Also, I still don't know what open data is.

## Joining spreadsheets
Now that I'm finished complaining about open data hype and lack of funds,
I'm going tell you about searching spreadsheets.
