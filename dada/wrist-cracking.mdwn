I use the phrase "wrist cracking" to describe...


## My discovery of this phenomenon
My wrists started cracking when I was 12 years old. I rather
distinctly remember the night that it suddenly started happening;
it was at the beginning of seventh grade, and I was working on
some social studies homework, probably late at night. I was typing
my homework at my computer. It was either during the night or the
next day that I noticed that my wrists cracked.

If I look around on old hard drives, I might be able to figure out
the exact date that this happened.

## Other literature on the topic
Ever since my wrists started cracking, I've asked and looked for
information on this phenomenon and have found nothing.

## Related work
The main reason I'm defining wrist cracking is so that I can talk
about a study that I'm doing on it.
