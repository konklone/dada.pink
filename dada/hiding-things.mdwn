The goal of hiding things from others is often to hide things from ourselves.
Or so I think. Without going into much detail about how I came to this
conclusion, I'm going to explain what I mean by this.

Some companies do bad things like destroy forests and ignore human rights.
But the individual people within these companies are just doing their jobs,
as part of this big exploitative machine. This organizational structure
wasn't invented with the goal of making it harder to punish people for doing
these bad things; it came about because people didn't want to admit that they
were contributing to such bad things.

When the head of police or whoever decides to break up a protest that isn't
being at all uncivilized, it's not really because he's afraid about what other
people are going to think about the protest; it's because he doesn't want to
think about the protest himself.

When the police prevent the press from seeing what is going on at the protest,
it's not really because the police are worried about what the public will think;
it's because the police don't want to be reminded of the protest.
(And it's because they're following orders and a bunch of other reasons too.)
