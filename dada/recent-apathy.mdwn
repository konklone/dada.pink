i don't think anyone cares
/dada/searching-data-tables-better



Some people get big and important in this openly open openness nonsense
by acting big and important
(govlab, okfn, code for aerica)
but I don't think it makes  them any happier



datahub.io server logs and some ideas of what to do with them,
but people don't care that much, they're not going to pay me,
and i'd rather sleep

socrata people say they're interested in helping me with thiss
stuff, but it never happens.

I went to
Open Knowledge Festival
for the first time last month, and I found it to be the most
stressful thing I'd done in a while. The previous similarly
stressful thing was
Transparency Camp.
Do you see the pattern here?

All of the frustrating things I describe above are very present
when you get a bunch of people together to be open about openness.



I don't really care about fixing government or saving the world,
/dada/datakind-is-kind/

and I don't usually like talking about computers.

I like being around people who make me feel nice, and the people
who care about open openness sometimes do this, but I don't like
the pressure to talk about open openness.
