i don't think anyone cares
/dada/searching-data-tables-better



Some people get big and important in this openly open openness nonsense
by acting big and important
(govlab, okfn, code for aerica)
but I don't think it makes  them any happier



datahub.io server logs and some ideas of what to do with them,
but people don't care that much, they're not going to pay me,
and i'd rather sleep

stuff, but it never happens.

I went to
Open Knowledge Festival
for the first time last month, and I found it to be the most
stressful thing I'd done in a while. The previous similarly
stressful thing was
Transparency Camp.
Do you see the pattern here?

All of the frustrating things I describe above are very present
when you get a bunch of people together to be open about openness.



I don't really care about fixing government or saving the world,
/dada/datakind-is-kind/

and I don't usually like talking about computers.
/dada/learning-data-stuff/

I like being around people who make me feel nice, and the people
who care about open openness sometimes do this, but I don't like
the pressure to talk about open openness.






Bigger people try to feel important by organizing smaller people
into projects under a big name. Smaller people who are looking
for some direction and purpose in life get sold on the open openness
(or whatever the trendy thing is). Then they decide that they need
to save the world with the open openness, so then they devote their
lives to one of these projects for bigger people.

The bigger people don't get much more important, and the smaller
people don't really done much for the world, but both groups try to
convince themselves that it was worth it.

Actually, that's wrong; people probably do get what they wanted out
of whenever they're doing, but the game that I describe above makes
everything more stressful than it needs to be. And I don't want things
to be more stressful; I'd rather have time to sleep.
