People Tweeted at me a lot yesterday about things that excite
me in the ways that they probably thought it would.

## Open data open data
A conversation started around studying how people use websites
that let you download spreadsheets (open data catalogs).
[This writing](http://govfresh.com/2014/07/time-open-data-open-data/)
sort of prompted the discussion, and Luke eventually asked if anyone
wants to
[do something](https://twitter.com/lukefretwell/status/497379906175524864)
around this topic of study.

It would be easy for me to look at
[all kinds of things](/open-data/)
on this topic, but I still don't manage to get myself to do very much.
I get the feeling that
[nobody cares](/dada/searching-data-tables-better)
very much about any of the stuff that I'm doing; they're only pretending.
And this includes
[all](http://codeforamerica.org/)
[of](http://sunlightfoundation.com/)
[those](http://data.gov/)
[organizations](http://ckan.org/)
[that](http://socrata.com)
[preach](http://nucivic.com/data/)
[open](http://www.code4sa.org/)
[openness](http://thegovlab.org/)


Well actually, that's not true;
some people like that I am confirming what they already think, which
is that this openly open openness is nebulous hype and that nobody has
any idea what is going on.

## Related projects
I [alluded](https://twitter.com/EllieAsksWhy/status/497277750466863104)
to a related thing that I'm vaguely working on. I figured that a decent
source of information about how these open data sites are used would be
the web server logs for these websites.

I've in fact been sitting on [datahub.io](https://datahub.io) server logs
for some time. I have many ideas of interesting things I could do with them,
but I still don't do any of them. I don't think people care that much, I'm
certainly not going to get paid, and I could just
[sleep](/dada/sleeping) instead.

Maybe I should instead work at
[a tenth of minimum wage](https://twitter.com/thomaslevine/status/497272565770231808)
to collect [data](http://usodi.org/2014/08/01/openaddresses)
for fancy innovative businesses that are going to save the
world by making lots of money and being more important than me.

## Why do people get excited about this stuff?
Other people seem a bit more excited about this openly open openness nonsense
than I do.

People want to feel like they're part of something big, so people organize
themselves into
[things](http://www.codeforamerica.org/)
[that](https://okfn.org)
[sound](http://www.socrata.com/)
[big](http://thegovlab.org/)
People who are looking for some direction and purpose in life get sold on
the open openness (or whatever the trendy thing is). Then they decide that
they need to save the world with the open openness, so then they devote their
lives to one of big and impressive projects/entities. And I don't think
that people find the purpose that they are looking for in such endeavours

## Deeper reasons for getting excited about open openness
While I doubt that this open openness helps much with the things in the
previous section, I think that people actually do get something they want
when they jump on the open openness bandwagon; it's just a bit more stressful
than it needs to be because people have to play the game I describe in the
previous section.

(And don't like playing these games because that's a lot of work and
I'd rather have time to sleep.)

Rather than fixing things, I like to make them more hilarious.

I went to
Open Knowledge Festival
for the first time last month, and I found it to be the most
stressful thing I'd done in a while. The previous similarly
stressful thing was
Transparency Camp.
Do you see the pattern here?

All of the frustrating things I describe above are very present
when you get a bunch of people together to be open about openness.



I don't really care about fixing government or saving the world,
/dada/datakind-is-kind/

and I don't usually like talking about computers.

I like being around people who make me feel nice, and the people
who care about open openness sometimes do this, but I don't like
the pressure to talk about open openness.
