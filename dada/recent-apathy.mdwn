Some people get big and important in this openly open openness nonsense
by acting big and important
(govlab, okfn, code for aerica)
but I don't think it makes  them any happier

but people don't care that much, they're not going to pay me,
and i'd rather sleep

socrata people say they're interested in helping me with thiss
stuff, but it never happens.
