I like to sleep,

( pictures )

and I'm pretty good at it. That is,
I seem to know some tricks that other people don't.

## Sleeping without a bed

* Cover eyes (sweater, shirt, &c.)
* Pillow (sweater, bricks, books, &c.)

## Sleeping for a long time

* Water
* Slowly walk to and from the bathroom without opening eyes
* 

## General

* Mouth above stomach
