### Bags
I recently got a [Tom Bihn Synapse 19](),
after reading [this review](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/tom-bihn-synapse-backpack/),
and I love it. I had noticed that I kept losing my toothbrush
and toothpaste and other small things like this. I wanted a
special place for each sort of small thing so that I would want
to put it away and be able to find it; without such a special
place, I would often take things out so that they wouldn't get
lost inside the one huge pocket in my Timbuk2 messenger bag.
Special things about the Tom Bihn Synapse 19 are that it has lots
of tiny pockets and is small.

I also got a storage unit for things that I didn't really need
day-to-day, like my power tools and belly dancing costuming.
And I'm switching my desktop for a laptop.

I started wondering whether I could fit everything into my
new backpack. I think that will be a bit tight, but I'm going to
try fitting this into the backpack and a small-size Ribz Front Pack.

### Contents
Here are the items that I will try to fit in these two packs.

* Computers
  * Laptop (ThinkPad X201) and power adapter
  * Projector (XXX), video cable, and power adapter
  * Phone (Nexus S), micro-USB cables, USB power adapter
* Clothes (including the clothes I'm wearing)
  * Four or five pairs of socks (Injinji Performance Series Toe Socks)
  * Four or five pairs of underwear
  * Two pairs of plastic pants
  * Shirts, all long-sleeved because I like those
    * Two plastic shirts (EMS Techwick from like 10 years ago)
    * One fancy shirt (probably Prada)
  * A cashmere hoodie
  * Maybe a water-resistant shell
* In winter
  * A thin wool sweater, preferably with zippered pockets
  * Maybe some Zippo hand warmers
  * Pink hat
  * Fingerless gloves
  * Maybe mittens
  * A pair of leggings
* Teeth things
  * Toothbrush
  * Toothpaste
  * Normal floss
  * Floss for under my braces
  * Retainer
  * Mouthwash
* Washing supplies
  * Soap
  * Maybe shampoo
  * Maybe conditioner
  * Jar of laundry powder (so I can bring it on a plane)
  * Maybe a container for soaking clothes, so I don't have to depend on having good sinks
      (maybe [this](http://www.rei.com/product/767560/sea-to-summit-x-bowl))
* Footwear
  * Pink Vibram FiveFingers
  * Boots (must be worn if I am to carry both pairs of shoes)
* Documents
  * Passport
  * Two checkbooks (two checking accounts)
  * Public transit cards (MetroCard, Oyster Card, Tap Card, &c.)
  * United States national identification (learner's permit)
  * Ordinary wallet things
* Empty space for food
* Other
  * Napkins
  * Pens
  * Keys
  * Empty plastic bags
  * Disposible water bottle
  * Small paper notebook

Heavy stuff that I use infrequently should go in the front pack.
This way, it balances the weight of the backpack, and I can drop
the front pack somewhere without adjusting my packing. The front pack
carries these things.

* Documents
* Washing supplies
* Projector
* Food
* "Other"

That's not very many things yet, so it'll probably also have these things too.

* Laptop charger
* Teeth things
* Some clothes

### Laptop computers
I'm starting to think that laptops are more portable than desktops.
This is what I want.

* Lots of RAM
* Cool-running CPU
* SSD
* Quiet (preferably with no fans)
* Light
* Big battery

Laptops produced in 2014 are way more powerful that I could possibly
need and not much lighter than 10-year-old laptops. With that in mind,
I see no reason to buy functional laptops; buy or otherwise acquire
broken laptops and replacement parts to fix them.

### Desktop computers
I have two bespoke, artisinal, quiet, hand-crafted-with-love
desktop computers.

One is in an Antec P180 Mini case. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM,
a decent CPU, quiet fans, and several hard drives.
It has lots of room or disk drives and PCI cards.
My father happens to want something like it, so I'm backing up
everything that's on it and am going to tell him how to fix it
up to be what he wants.

One has an Akasa Euler case. It has 16 gigabytes of RAM an SSD,
a decent CPU, and no room for disk drives. It presently has no
wireless network ability, but I have a wireless network card that
might work with it. It has no moving parts, so it's pretty quiet.
[These people](https://twitter.com/thomaslevine/status/439103995894697984)
seem interested in it.

### Other givaways
I have multiple routers and wireless network cards that I'm not using
and lots of books, mainly on statistics, ergonomics, and typography.

## February 2014
Three months ago, I noticed that everything in my apartment that
I cared about fit in a big suitcase and a big backpack. That was
small enough that I thought it would be fun and easy to bounce
around between different places.

But it felt silly to carry all that stuff, so
I've since gotten the stuff down to a small suitcase and a small
messenger bag; here it is.

![Stuff laid out on a floor](stuff-annotated.jpg){:.wide}

The larger things are

* Five shirts
* More than five pairs of socks and underwear
* Two pairs of pants
* Two sweaters
* A jacket
* A Dremel
* A coin belt (for belly dancing)
* Papers that I really don't need
* Toiletries

I think I can get rid of some of the papers, some of the socks, and
some of the underwear.
