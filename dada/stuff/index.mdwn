## May 2014
I recently got a [Tom Bihn Synapse 19](),
and I love it. I had noticed that I kept losing my toothbrush
and toothpaste and other small things like this. I wanted a
special place for each sort of small thing so that I would want
to put it away and be able to find it; without such a special
place, I would often take things out so that they wouldn't get
lost inside the one huge pocket in my Timbuk2 messenger bag.
Special things about the Tom Bihn Synapse 19 are that it has lots
of tiny pockets and is small.

I also got a storage unit for things that I didn't really need
day-to-day, like my power tools and belly dancing costuming.
And I'm switching my desktop for a laptop.

I started wondering whether I could fit everything into my
new backpack. I think that will be a bit tight, but I'm going to
try to get it into this backpack and front pack, either a Ribz
Front Pack or a Pacsafe Venturesafe 10L GII Front Pack.

Three months ago, I noticed that everything in my apartment that
I cared about fit in a big suitcase and a big backpack. That was
small enough that I thought it would be fun and easy to bounce
around between different places.

But it felt silly to carry all that stuff, so
I've since gotten the stuff down to a small suitcase and a small
messenger bag; here it is.

The larger things are

* Five shirts
* More than five pairs of socks and underwear
* Two pairs of pants
* Two sweaters
* A jacket
* A Dremel
* A coin belt (for belly dancing)
* Papers that I really don't need
* Toiletries

I think I can get rid of some of the papers, some of the socks, and
some of the underwear.
