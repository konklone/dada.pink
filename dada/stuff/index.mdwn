## Bags
I have a [Tom Bihn Synapse 19](http://www.tombihn.com/PROD/TB0110.html)
and a [Ribz Front Pack](http://www.ribzwear.com/ribz-front-pack/), small-size.

I also got a storage unit for things that I didn't really need
day-to-day, like my power tools and belly dancing costuming.

## Contents
Here are the contents of these bags.

* Computers
  * Laptop (Acer Aspire One 725-0488) and power adapter
  * Aaxa P300 projector, HDMI cable, and power adapter

Heavy stuff that I use infrequently should go in the front pack.
This way, it balances the weight of the backpack, and I can drop
the front pack somewhere without adjusting my packing. The front pack
carries these things.

* Documents
* Washing supplies
* Projector
* Food
* "Other"

The following things go in the back pack

* The laptop itself (It's too big for the front pack. )
* A few [sample containers](http://samplecontainerstore.ecrater.com/c/219972/sample-containers)
    of shampoo, laundry powder, and sunscreen
* Teeth things
* Vibram FiveFingers

## Likely changes

* Switch the Acer Aspire One 725-0488 for a ThinkPad X201.
* Switch the earmuffs for custom earmuffs.
* Switch one pair of plastic pants for a pair of cotton shorts.
