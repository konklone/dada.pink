Everything I need to carry when I move house fits in a
[Tom Bihn Synapse 19](http://www.tombihn.com/PROD/TB0110.html)
(I also have a storage unit for things that I didn't really need
day-to-day, like my power tools and belly dancing costuming.)
Here are those things.

* Computers
  * Laptop (Acer Aspire One 725-0488) and power adapter
  * Phone (Nexus S), many micro-USB cables, USB power adapter
* Clothes (including the clothes I'm wearing)
  * Four pairs of [Injinji](http://www.injinji.com/) Performance Series Toe Socks
  * Four pairs of cotton underwear
  * One pair of plastic long pants
  * One pair of plastic short pants
  * Three plastic shirts (long-sleeved EMS Techwick with half-height zipper)
  * Water-resistant jacket
  * Warm sweater (optional)
* Teeth things
  * Toothbrush
  * Toothpaste (travel-size only)
  * Normal floss
  * Floss for under my braces
  * Retainer
* Footwear
  * Pink Vibram FiveFingers
  * Boots (must be worn if I am to carry both pairs of shoes)
* Documents
  * Passport
  * A few blank cheques
  * Public transit cards (MetroCard, Oyster Card, Tap Card, &c.)
  * United States national identification (learner's permit)
  * Ordinary wallet things
* Empty space for food
* Other
  * Small paper notebook
  * Pens
  * Keys
* Supplies stored in tiny cosmetic sample containers
  * [Blue Lizard](http://www.bluelizard.net/) sunscreen
  * Shampoo
  * Laundry powder (powder so I can bring it on a plane)
* Supplies stored with no special container
  * Napkins
  * Empty plastic bags
  * Disposible water bottle
* An empty [Ribz Front Pack](http://www.ribzwear.com/ribz-front-pack/), small-size, for extra space in an emergency and for separating dirty laundry.

## Notable non-contents
There is no pillow nor towel; clothes can be used for these purposes.

A bed, bed sheets, and blankets are excluded. I can take these with me,
but I would need to bring another bag to carry it.

The above contents account for free space for food, but the specific foods
are not listed.

I have an Aaxa P300 projector (with HDMI cable, and power adapter) that
I have previously found useful but have removed to keep things small.

The supplies need to be refilled as I use them.
If I'm in the same place for a while, I purchase larger containers of these things.

## Likely changes

* Switch the Acer Aspire One 725-0488 for a ThinkPad X201.
* Switch the earmuffs for custom earplugs.
* Switch one pair of plastic pants for a pair of cotton shorts.
* Get a small container for mouthwash
* Do something about my glasses; I have three pairs, and that takes up a lot of space.
