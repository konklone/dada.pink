(data table slide)

The [data table](http://www.datakind.org/blog/whats-in-a-table/)
is an intuitive paradigm for many people. In a tidy data table, rows
correspond to observations/records, and columns to variables/attributes
collected about each observation/record.

We can use spreadsheets to represent data tables, and we can use
data tables to represent musical scores.

In this figure we see music represented in two forms.

Each column in the spreadsheet corresponds to a staff in the sheet music,

Each row in the spreadsheet corresponds to a beat,

and different notes are in different columns.
Here is how my music synthesizer, SheetMusic, does the conversion
between spreadsheets and ordinary sheet music.

We can use color to represent dynamics (how loud or soft the sound is).

Music is often divided into measures. In sheet music, this is typically
represented with bars, and we can do the same in spreadsheets.

The point here is that lots of things can be represented as data tables.
Spreadsheets are a good way for working with data tables, so we can use
spreadsheets to work with music.

But spreadsheets are also code, so we can use them to make music!
For example, sheetmusic provides a "third_interval" function for making
a third interval in a particular key.

I find that people are overly constrained in their perception of what
