(data table slide)

The [data table](http://www.datakind.org/blog/whats-in-a-table/)
is an intuitive paradigm for many people. In a tidy data table, rows
correspond to observations/records, and columns to variables/attributes
collected about each observation/record.

We can use spreadsheets to represent data tables, and we can use
data tables to represent musical scores.

(spreadsheet versus ordinary sheet music slide)

In this figure we see music represented in two forms.

(spreadsheet versus ordinary sheet music slide, with column/staff highlighted)

Each column in the spreadsheet corresponds to a staff in the sheet music,

(spreadsheet versus ordinary sheet music slide, with row/beat highlighted)

and each row in the spreadsheet corresponds to a beat.

(spreadsheet versus ordinary sheet music slide, with styles for dynamics)

We can use color to represent dynamics (how loud or soft the sound is).

(spreadsheet versus ordinary sheet music slide, with borders for bars)

Music is often divided into measures. In sheet music, this is typically
represented with bars, and we can do the same in spreadsheets.

Spreadsheets store data, so we can use them just as we can use any data
table format.

(Slide: synthesizer functions)

Spreadsheets are also code, so we can use them to make music.
I wrote a package that lets you use a spreadsheet as a music synthesizer.

("pip2 install sheetmusic")

To be confusing, let's call it "SheetMusic".

I find that people are overly constrained in their perception of what
