[[!meta title="Curriculum vitae"]]

I wonder what the point of a CV is. If I'm not doing the conventional
academic thing, I don't really need the typical CV. But why is it desireable?
To some degree, it's a summary of a person. My website is also a summary
of me too, but it ignores some typical contents of a CV.

I think a CV is intended to make someone sound impressive. I sort
of don't like doing that, but I'm curious about what it would sound like.
And I'm applying to a graduate school (April 1, 2014). So here I go.

If you dare read this, keep in mind that I'm inflating things in order
to play the real-world game. If you are me and you want to print it out
so you can submit it to some fancy place, go [here](cv).
